Process Algebra and Probabilistic Methods. Performance Modelling and Verification : Joint International Workshop, PAPM-PROBMIV 2001 Aachen, Germany, September 12â€“14, 2001 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Process Algebra and Performance Modeling and Probabilistic Methods in Verification, PAPM-PROBMIV 2001, held in Aachen, Germany in September 2001.The 12 revised full papers presented together with one invited paper were carefully reviewed and selected from 23 submissions. Among the topics addressed are model representation, model checking, probabilistic systems analysis, refinement, Markov chains, random variables, stochastic timed systems, Max-Plus algebra, process algebra, system modeling, and the Mobius modeling framework
