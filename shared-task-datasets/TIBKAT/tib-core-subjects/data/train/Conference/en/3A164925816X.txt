Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems — CHES 2001 : Third International Workshop Paris, France, May 14–16, 2001 Proceedings
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Cryptoanalysis Hardware and Embedded Systems, CHES 2001, held in Paris, France in Mai 2001. The 31 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 66 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on side channel attacks, Rijndael hardware implementation, random number generators, elliptic curve algorithms, arithmetic architectures, cryptanalysis, embedded implementations of ciphers, and side channel attacks on elliptic curve cryptosystems
