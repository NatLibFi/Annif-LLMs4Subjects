Experimental, computational, and corpus-based approaches to language learning : evidence and interpretation
"Language acquisition occupies a central place in the study of human cognition, and research&nbsp;on how we learn language can be found across many disciplines, from developmental psychology and linguistics to education, philosophy and neuroscience. The investigation of a complex phenomenon like language acquisition naturally requires insights, tools, and methods&nbsp;from many disciplines, yet it is still relatively rare to find studies that combine multiple&nbsp;approaches. This volume brings together leading researchers in cognitive psychology, corpus&nbsp;research, developmental psychology, linguistics, and natural language processing to discuss&nbsp;opportunities and challenges of combining multiple approaches to language learning. The peer-reviewed chapters in this volume are written in an accessible and engaging fashion.&nbsp;Together, they provide the reader with a panorama of the exciting research currently being&nbsp;conducted at the intersection of experimental, computational and corpus-based approaches&nbsp;to language learning. <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">chology</div> <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">and linguistics to education, philosophy and neuroscience.

"The special issue contains conceptual and empirical papers combining perspectives from a range of disciplines including second language research, corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and cognitive psychology. Papers (a) discuss recent work and trends, (b) outline opportunities and challenges of working across disciplinary and methodological boundaries as well as (c) propose directions for future research. The special issue is inspired by a symposium organized by the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science at Lancaster University and the journal Language Learning (2015)"--
