Liquid salts for energy and materials : The University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China, 11-13 May 2016
This volume focuses on recent developments in the understanding and energy and material processing applications of liquid salts. Due to their great range of working temperatures, liquid salts -- including oxide melts, ionic liquids, and deep eutectic solvents -- can offer significant benefits for improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the production of many materials and processing technologies. A great many opportunities remain for these species, particularly for thermal, electrochemical and nuclear energy vectors. Even fossil energy, and the related COâ‚‚ capture, conversion and utilisation can be accommodated efficiently in liquid salt-based processes and devices. Technological advancement in these areas relies heavily on a sound understanding of the underlying science of the large number of liquid salts and their widely varying properties. This volume discusses and debates the state of the art in liquid salts, highlighting recent developments in our understanding of their fundamental properties and how their application can help in addressing some of the most important current global challenges
