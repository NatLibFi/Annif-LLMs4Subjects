Job scheduling strategies for parallel processing : 9th international workshop ; revised papers
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed postproceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing, JSSPP 2003, held in Seattle, Washington in June 2003 in conjunction with HPDC-12 and FFG-8. The 13 revised full papers presented were carefully refereed and selected during two rounds of reviewing and revision. The papers present state-of- the-art research results in the area with particular emphasis on conventional parallel systems (including infrastucture scheduling algorithms, I/O issues, and QoS), on scheduling issues in the context of grid computing, and on methodological aspects of performance evaluation in parallel job scheduling
