Latent Variable Modeling and Applications to Causality
This volume gathers refereed papers presented at the 1994 UCLA conference on "Latent Variable Modeling and Application to Causality." The papers in this volume are representative of a wide variety of disciplines in which the use of latent varible models is rapidly growing. The volume is divided into two broad sections. The first section covers Path Modela and Causal Reasoning, and the chapters are innovations from contributions in disciplines not traditionally associated with the behavorial sciences, such as computer science and public health. The second section encompasses new approaches to questions of model selection with an emphasis on factor analysis and time varying systems. All the chapters present new results not published elsewhere
