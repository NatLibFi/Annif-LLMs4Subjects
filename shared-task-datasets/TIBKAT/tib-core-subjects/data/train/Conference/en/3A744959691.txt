Transdisciplinarity: Joint Problem Solving among Science, Technology, and Society : An Effective Way for Managing Complexity
Transdisciplinarity is a new approach to research and problem solving. The core idea is that researchers, practitioners and stakeholders must cooperate in order to address the complex challenges of society. The International Transdisciplinarity Conference, held in Switzerland in early 2000, produced a platform of theory and practice. This book contains definitions, keynote addresses, summaries of sessions and panels, and names recipients of the Swiss Transdisciplinarity Award. Key topics include the nature of transdisciplinarity, research management, knowledge integration, mutual learning, teamwork and stakeholder involvement, guidelines for good practice, institutional structures, North-South partnerships, and evaluation. The audience includes all disciplinary and interdisciplinary researchers concerned with sustainability and practitioners and stakeholders in a wide variety of areas (energy, natural resources, urban and landscape planning, waste management, biotechnology, health care, and education)
