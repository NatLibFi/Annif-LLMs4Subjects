The European Conferences on Numerical Mathematics and Advanced Applications (ENUMATH) are a series of conferences held every two years to provide a forum for discussion of new trends in numerical mathematics and challenging scientific and industrial applications at the highest level of international expertise. ENUMATH 2011 was hosted by the University of Leicester (UK) from the 5th to 9th September 2011. This proceedings volume contains more than 90 papers by speakers of the conference and gives an overview of recent developments in scientific computing, numerical analysis, and practical use of modern numerical techniques and algorithms in various applications. New results on finite element methods, multiscale methods, numerical linear algebra, and finite difference schemes are presented. A range of applications include computational problems from fluid dynamics, materials, image processing, and molecular dynamics.
