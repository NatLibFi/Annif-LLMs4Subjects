Invariant Theory
This volume of expository papers is the outgrowth of a conference in combinatorics and invariant theory. In recent years, newly developed techniques from algebraic geometry and combinatorics have been applied with great success to some of the outstanding problems of invariant theory, moving it back to the forefront of mathematical research once again. This collection of papers centers on constructive aspects of invariant theory and opens with an introduction to the subject by F. Grosshans. Its purpose is to make the current research more accesssible to mathematicians in related fields
