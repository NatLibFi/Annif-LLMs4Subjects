This book is based on lectures given at the first edition of the Domoschool, the International Alpine School in Mathematics and Physics, held in Domodossola, Italy, in July 2018. It is divided into two parts. Part I consists of four sets of lecture notes. These are extended versions of lectures given at the Domoschool, written by well-known experts in mathematics and physics related to General Relativity. Part II collects talks by selected participants, focusing on research related to General Relativity
