Solar wind ten : proceedings of the Tenth International Solar Wind Conference, Pisa, Italy, 17 - 21 June 2002
The Tenth Solar Wind conference describes the latest results in the physics of the outer solar atmosphere, the solar wind, and the interplanetary medium which together comprise the heliosphere. The conference brought together researchers studying the sun and its influence on the earthâ€™s space environment both from an experimental and theoretical point of view. The effect of the solar magnetic field in shaping and accelerating the solar wind throughout the solar cycle, via coronal heating and coronal mass ejections was described in unprecedented clarity and breadth, thanks to both satellite experiments and numerical modelling. The conference proceedings is of interest to researchers in space science and the geomagnetic effects of solar activity, plasma physicists and astrophysicists as well as other scientists interested in the life of our mother star.
