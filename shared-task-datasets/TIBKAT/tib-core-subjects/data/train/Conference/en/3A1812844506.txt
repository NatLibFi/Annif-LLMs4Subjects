Energy technology 2021 : carbon dioxide management and other technologies
Clean and sustainable energy is of paramount importance for industrial activities, economic development, environment, and welfare of civilians. As such, research on generation, storage, and application of clean energy is a central concern of both academia and industry. This collection addresses the pressing needs for sustainable technologies with reduced energy consumption and environmental pollutions and the development and application of alternative sustainable energy to maintain a green environment and efficient and long-lasting energy supply. Contributors represent both industry and academia and focus on new and efficient energy technologies including innovative ore beneficiation, smelting technologies, and recycling and waste heat recovery, as well as emerging novel energy solutions. The volume also covers a broad range of mature and new technological aspects of sustainable energy ecosystems, processes that improve energy efficiency, reduce thermal emissions, and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions
