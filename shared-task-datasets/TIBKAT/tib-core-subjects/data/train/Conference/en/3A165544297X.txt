Multigrid Methods V : Proceedings of the Fifth European Multigrid Conference held in Stuttgart, Germany, October 1–4, 1996
This volume contains a selection from the papers presented at the Fifth European Multigrid Conference, held in Stuttgart, October 1996. All contributions were carefully refereed. The conference was organized by the Institute for Computer Applications (ICA) of the University of Stuttgart, in cooperation with the GAMM Committee for Scientific Computing, SFB 359 and 404 and the reserach network WiR Ba-Wü. The list of topics contained lectures on Multigrid Methods: robustness, adaptivity, wavelets, parallelization, application in computational fluid dynamics, porous media flow, optimisation and computational mechanics. A considerable part of the talks focused on algebraic multigrid methods
