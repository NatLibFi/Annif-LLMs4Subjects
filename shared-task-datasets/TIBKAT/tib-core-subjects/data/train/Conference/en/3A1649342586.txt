Information and Communications Security : First International Conference, ICIS'97, Beijing, China, November 11-14, 1997, Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the First International Conference on Information and Communication Security, ICICS '97, held in Beijing, China in November 1997. The 37 revised full papers presented were selected from a total of 87 submissions. Also included are 11 short papers. The book is divided in sections on theoretical foundations of security, secret sharing, network security, authentication and identification, Boolean functions and stream ciphers, security evaluation, signatures, public key systems, cryptanalysis of public key systems, subliminal channels, key recovery, intellectual property protection, protocols, and electronic commerce
