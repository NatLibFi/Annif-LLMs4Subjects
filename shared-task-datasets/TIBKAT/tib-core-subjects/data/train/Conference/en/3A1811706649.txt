This book constitutes the proceedings of the 18th Conference on Computability in Europe, CiE 2022, in Swansea, UK, in July 2022. The 19 full papers together with 7 invited papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 41 submissions. The motto of CiE 2022 was “Revolutions and revelations in computability”. This alludes to the revolutionary developments we have seen in computability theory, starting with Turing's and Gödel's discoveries of the uncomputable and the unprovable and continuing to the present day with the advent of new computational paradigms such as quantum computing and bio-computing, which have dramatically changed our view of computability and revealed new insights into the multifarious nature of computation.
