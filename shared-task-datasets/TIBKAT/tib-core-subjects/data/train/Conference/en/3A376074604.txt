The unity of mathematics : in honor of the ninetieth birthday of I. M. Gelfand ; [International Conference on the Unity of Mathematics, August 31st - September 4th 2003]
(Very preliminary) A tribute to the vision and legacy of Israel Gelfand, the invited papers in this volume reflect the unity of mathematics as a whole, with particular emphasis onthe many connections among the fields of geometry, physics, and representation theory. Written by leading mathematicians, the text is broadly divided into two sections: the first is devoted to developments at the intersection of geometry and physics, and the second to representation theory and algebraic geometry. Topics include conformal field theory, K-theory, noncommutative geometry, gauge theory, representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, and various aspects of the Langlands program. Graduate students and researchers will benefit from and find inspiration in this broad and unique work, which brings together fundamental results ina number of disciplines andhighlights the rewards of an interdisciplinary approach to mathematics and physics.
