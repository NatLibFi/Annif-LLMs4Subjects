The conference attracts researchers not only from Central and Eastern Europe but also from other parts of the world. One of its goals has always been bringing together NLP researchers with various interests from different parts of the world and promoting their cooperation. One of the ambitions of the conference is, not only to deal with dialogue systems but also to improve dialogue among researchers in areas of NLP, i.e., among the "text" and the "speech" and the "dialogue" people
