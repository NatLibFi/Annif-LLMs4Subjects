Logical Foundations of Computer Science : International Symposium, LFCS 2020, Deerfield Beach, FL, USA, January 4-7, 2020, Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the International Symposium on Logical Foundations of Computer Science, LFCS 2020, held in Deerfield Beach, FL, USA, in January 2020. The 17 revised full papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 30 submissions. The scope of the Symposium is broad and includes constructive mathematics and type theory; homotopy type theory; logic, automata, and automatic structures; computability and randomness; logical foundations of programming; logical aspects of computational complexity; parameterized complexity; logic programming and constraints; automated deduction and interactive theorem proving; logical methods in protocol and program verification; logical methods in program specification and extraction; domain theory logics; logical foundations of database theory; equational logic and term rewriting; lambda and combinatory calculi; categorical logic and topological semantics; linear logic; epistemic and temporal logics; intelligent and multiple-agent system logics; logics of proof and justification; non-monotonic reasoning; logic in game theory and social software; logic of hybrid systems; distributed system logics; mathematical fuzzy logic; system design logics; other logics in computer science.
