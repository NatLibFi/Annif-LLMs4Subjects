Relativistic Flows in Astrophysics
The topic of this book is the study of relativistic outflows such as those seen in gamma-ray bursts, microquasars and active galactic nuclei. The book starts with lectures on physical processes relevant to all astrophysical systems exhibiting relativistic flows. Further lectures concentrate on more specific aspects such as various mechanisms for particle acceleration and radiation from relativistically moving sources. This volume will thus be of interest to postgraduate students and nonspecialist researchers as a tutorial introduction to this subject as well as for the experienced researcher looking for a modern source of reference
