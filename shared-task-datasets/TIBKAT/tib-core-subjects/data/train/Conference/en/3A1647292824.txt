Glycobiology and Medicine : Proceedings of the 7th Jenner Glycobiology and Medicine Symposium
The potential for glycobiology to improve the practice of medicine has been well recognised, which is why biannual meetings concerning the association have been taking place for the last 14 years. The science of glycobiology has matured rapidly, and with it the far reaching clinical implications are becoming understood. The next decade is going to see this final frontier of science conquered. The impact this understanding of glycobiology will have upon our practice of medicine is going to be exciting. The 7th Jenner Glycobiology and Medicine Symposium was designed to reflect these advances. All the major clinical areas were involved, with contributions from pivotal players in science and medicine.
