Vortex Structure and Dynamics : Lectures of a Workshop Held in Rouen, France, April 27â€“28, 1999
The object of this book is to present the state of the art and to summarize the most recent advances in the structure and dynamics of vortices. This subject has indeed recently made some remarkable progress, particularly thanks to stu- dies of turbulence, where coherent structures have been shown to play an important role. The book presents four ge- neral reviews on the experimental, numerical, theoretical, and 2D-vortex aspects. In addition to these reviews, a se- ries of articles describe a cross-section of recent work. Some of these studies are concerned with related fields, such as turbulence, aerodynamics, wakes, geophysics, mixing, and particle dynamics
