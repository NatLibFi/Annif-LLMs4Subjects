Modern computational science 11 : simulation of extreme events ; lecture notes from the 3rd international summer school, Oldenburg, August 15 - 26, 2011
Extreme weather events (storms, floodings, etc.), financial crashes, traffic disasters, and many similar phenomena occuring in natural and other systems often have tremendous social, political, and economic consequences. It does not come as a surprise then that the theory of rare (or 'extreme') events, which has proven (and continues to prove) highly valuable for understanding such phenomena on a quantitative level, is a very active research field. The present volume collects contributions from the International Summer School 'Modern Computational Science 2011' held at the University of Oldenburg, Germany. The first part deals with basic methods and techniques of Scientific Computing needed for the simulation of extreme events and in many other contexts. The following parts provide both an introduction to the mathematical background of rare-event theory, as well as applications to current research problems in the physics of socio-economic systems, bioinformatics, and transport and traffic planning. <engl.>
