International Symposium on Interfacial Structure held in conjunction with the 210th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society on August 20 - 25, 1995 in Chicago ... 1996 Chemistry at Interfaces Gordon Research Conference held July 21 - 26, 1996 in Meriden, New Hampshire ... 11th Surfactants in Solution Conference held June 9 - 13, 1996 in Jerusalem ...]
The subject of this volume is limited in that it addresses amphiphiles at liquid/air, liquid/liquid, and liquid/solid interfaces, with litte attention paid to vapor/solid interfaces. This volume will serve to summarize our current understanding of interfacial structure at the molecular level in these systems, and the relation of this structure to chemical and physicochemical phenomena
