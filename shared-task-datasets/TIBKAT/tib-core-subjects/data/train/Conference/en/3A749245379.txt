Structural, Syntactic, and Statistical Pattern Recognition : Joint IAPR International Workshops, SSPR 2004 and SPR 2004, Lisbon, Portugal, August 18-20, 2004. Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Structural and Syntactic Pattern Recognition, SSPR 2004 and the 5th International Workshop on Statistical Techniques in Pattern Recognition, SPR 2004, held jointly in Lisbon, Portugal, in August 2004. The 59 revised full papers and 64 revised poster papers presented together with 4 invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 219 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on graphs; visual recognition and detection; contours, lines, and paths; matching and superposition; transduction and translation; image and video analysis; syntactics, languages, and strings; human shape and action; sequences and graphs; pattern matching and classification; document image analysis; shape analysis; multiple classifier systems; density estimation; clustering; feature selection; classification; and representation
