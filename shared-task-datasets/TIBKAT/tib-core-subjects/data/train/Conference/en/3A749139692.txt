Advanced Technologies for Air Traffic Flow Management : Proceedings of an International Seminar Organized by Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) Bonn, Germany, April 1994
Papers in this book address the relationship between society and traffic, the potential of demand management and methods of mathematical modelling of traffic flows. An extensive overview is given of current state of the art Flow Management. Leading examples of flow management systems (Eurocontrol and FAA) are discussed in detail. Examples of advanced new concepts and products using machine intelligence for the optimization of ATF are described. Frankfurt Airport is used to show the potential for capacity improvements by the use of advanced technologies
