Värikkäämpi, iloisempi, hienostuneempi : näkökulmia 1960-luvun arkkitehtuuriin
The sixties marked an era of great social and cultural upheaval. With Finland in the midst of rapid urbanization, new buildings sprang up like mushrooms all over the country. Mass production revolutionized modernist architecture. The new Welfare State found tangible expression in the nation's administrative centres, cultural buildings, concrete churches, schools, universities and other public buildings. Suburban supermarkets proliferated with growth in automobile ownership and decentralized housing development.0The exhibition looks at the themes, visual idiosyncrasies and aesthetics of the sixties on a level targeted at general audiences. It also invites audiences to contemplate social themes and provides an introduction to Finland's key architects of the sixties. The architecture of the "crazy sixties" may leave opinions divided, but it rarely leaves anyone cold.00Exhibition: Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, Finland (12.10.2016-22.01.2017)
