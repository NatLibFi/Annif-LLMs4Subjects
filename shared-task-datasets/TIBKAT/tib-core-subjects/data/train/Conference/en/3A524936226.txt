Complex Computing-Networks : Brain-like and Wave-oriented Electrodynamic Algorithms
The Symposium CCN2005, Complex Computing-Networks: A Link between Brain-Like and Wave-Oriented Electrodynamics Algorithms was held at the Dogus University, Istanbul in June 2005. It uniquely combines the electromagnetic and circuits theory disciplines. As a result, this proceedings-book presents recent advances in the fields of electromagnetics, nonlinear systems, and their computational aspects. Included are celebration-documents of the bestowal of the honorary doctoral degree on Leopold B. Felsen and Leon Chua.
