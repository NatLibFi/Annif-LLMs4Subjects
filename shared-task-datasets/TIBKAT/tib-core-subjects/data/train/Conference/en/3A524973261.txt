Recent Advances in Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering and Microzonation
This book presents a comprehensive coverage of the two interrelated and interdisciplinary fields of seismic microzonation and earthquake geotechnical engineering. The introduction and the first chapter by two prominent researchers in the field of earthquake geotechnical engineering are setting the stage for the main theme of the book. The second chapter gives a general overview of the methods for estimating earthquake impact in large urban areas and the importance of the scale in zonation studies. The six following chapters are dealing with the main topics of strong ground motion, site characterization, site effects, liquefaction, and seismic microzonation. The last three chapters are concerned with geotechnical earthquake engineering, with special emphasis on solid waste landfills and lining systems, and earthquake resistant design of shallow and deep foundation subjected to earthquakes. A CD-ROM containing full-color versions of figures which are printed in black-and-white in the book itself, is also included.
