Nanostructures and Quantum Effects : Proceedings of the JRDC International Symposium, Tsukuba, Japan, November 17-18, 1993
Nanostructures and Quantum Effects documents the most recent developments in the field of quantum effects in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wires and boxes. Interrelated topics such as quantum interference, low-dimensional electron transport, single-electron and microcavity effects, electron holography, and quantum measurements together with the most recent progress in epitaxial growth of nanostructures and the manipulation of atoms using STM-related approaches are covered
