Raising Public Awareness of Mathematics
This collective book aims to encourage and inspire actions directed towards raising public awareness of the importance of mathematical sciences for our contemporary society in a cultural and historical perspective. Mathematical societies, in Europe and around the world, can find ideas, blueprints and suggestions for activities – including concerted actions with other international organizations – directed towards raising public awareness of science, technology and other fields where mathematics plays a strong role. The material is divided into four parts: • National experiences • Exhibitions / mathematical museums • Popularization activities • Popularization: why and how?
Preface -- Part 1 National Experiences -- Part 2 Exhibitions and Mathematical Museums -- Part 3 Popularisation Activities -- Part 4 Popularisation, Why and How.
