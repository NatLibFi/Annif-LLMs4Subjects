Transactional Agents : Towards a Robust Multi-Agent System
This book enhances the robustness of MAS applied in the information systems domain through an underlying middleware; this middleware provides formal guarantees on the robustness of the system by itself and independently of the original structure of the MAS architecture. Much of today`s progress in IT is due to interdisciplinary approaches - or to changing viewpoints on a particular problem. This monograph is an excellent example of such an interdisciplinary approach that brings together database knowledge rarely concerned with agents, and agent techniques that have had little to do with database technology
