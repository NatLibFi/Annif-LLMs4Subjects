This book contains extended and revised versions of the best papers presented at the 27th IFIP WG 10.5/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration, VLSI-SoC 2019, held in Cusco, Peru, in October 2019. The 15 full papers included in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from the 28 papers (out of 82 submissions) presented at the conference. The papers discuss the latest academic and industrial results and developments as well as future trends in the field of System-on-Chip (SoC) design, considering the challenges of nano-scale, state-of-the-art and emerging manufacturing technologies. In particular they address cutting-edge research fields like heterogeneous, neuromorphic and brain-inspired, biologically-inspired, approximate computing systems
