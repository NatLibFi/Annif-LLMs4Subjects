Principles of magnetic resonance imaging : a signal processing perspective
In 1971 Dr. Paul C. Lauterbur pioneered spatial information encoding principles that made image formation possible by using magnetic resonance signals. Now Lauterbur, "father of the MRI", and Dr. Zhi-Pei Liang have co-authored the first engineering textbook on magnetic resonance imaging. This long-awaited, definitive text will help undergraduate and graduate students of biomedical engineering, biomedical imaging scientists, radiologists, and electrical engineers gain an in-depth understanding of MRI principles. The authors use a signal processing approach to describe the fundamentals of magnetic resonance imaging. You will find a clear and rigorous discussion of these carefully selected essential topics: . Mathematical fundamentals. Signal generation and detection principles. Signal characteristics. Signal localization principles. Image reconstruction techniques. Image contrast mechanisms. Image resolution, noise, and artifacts. Fast-scan imaging. Constrained reconstruction Complete with a comprehensive set of examples and homework problems, Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the must-read book to improve your knowledge of this revolutionary technique
