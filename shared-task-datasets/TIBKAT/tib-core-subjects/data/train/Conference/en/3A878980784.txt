Neither east nor west : the Lafayette Collection: Asia in the age of Monochrome
The exhibition at the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia which it accompanies - reveals how people from the two 'ends of the earth' met at London's Lafayette photographic studio in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The portraits convey vital messages about identity and self-perception in an age of Western hegemony. Populated with sultans and rajahs, diplomats and socialites, this volume is a feast for the eyes and a rewarding read for anyone interested in globalisation and questions of dress and identity.
