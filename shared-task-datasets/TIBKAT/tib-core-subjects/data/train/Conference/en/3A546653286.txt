Nanotechnology and occupational health : [most of the articles in this volume are invited papers from the 2nd International Symposium on Nanotechnology and Occupational Health, held in Minneapolis, MN, October 3 - 6, 2005]
Nanotechnology is rapidly invading many aspects of modern society - from science, research and engineering to industrial and commercial applications and, inevitably, to man and his environment. One of the biggest challenges, therefore, is managing environmental, health and safety risks of nanomaterials. Yet, the information necessary to assess their long term effects is scarce. Systematic research into what potentially makes engineered nanomaterials hazardous, how this translates into risk, and how these can be managed will be vital and involves interdisciplinary collaboration. The first Inter
This volume, a reprint from a special issue of the Journal of Nanoparticle Research, draws on work presented at The Second International Symposium on Nanotechnology and Occupational Health, held in Minnesota in 2005. It presents an interdisciplinary approach to nanotechnology and occupational health and offers an overview of recent developments toward assessment and management of hazards and risks associated with engineered nanomaterials.
