Comparative genomics : RECOMB 2004 International Workshop, RCG 2004, Bertinoro, Italy, October 16 - 19, 2004 ; revised selected papers
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the RECOMB 2004 Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics, RCG 2004, held in Bertinoro, Italy in October 2004. The 10 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and improved for inclusion in the book. The papers address a broad variety of aspects of comparative genomics ranging from new quantitative discoveries about genome structures and processes to theorems on the complexity of computational problems inspired by genome comparison
