New directions in function theory: from complex to hypercomplex to non-commutative : Chapman University, November 2019
This volume presents selected contributions from experts gathered at Chapman University for a conference held in November 2019 on new directions in function theory. The papers, written by leading researchers in the field, relate to hypercomplex analysis, Schur analysis and de Branges spaces, new aspects of classical function theory, and infinite dimensional analysis. Signal processing constitutes a strong presence in several of the papers. A second volume in this series of conferences, this book will appeal to mathematicians interested in learning about new fields of development in function theory.
