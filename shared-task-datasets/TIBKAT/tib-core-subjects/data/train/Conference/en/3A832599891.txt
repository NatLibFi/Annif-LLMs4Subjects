Proceedings of the Second HPI Cloud Symposium "Operating the Cloud" 2014
Every year, the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) invites guests from industry and academia to a collaborative scientific workshop on the topic “Operating the Cloud”. Our goal is to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge and experience between industry and academia. Hence, HPI’s Future SOC Lab is the adequate environment to host this event which is also supported by BITKOM. On the occasion of this workshop we called for submissions of research papers and practitioners’ reports. “Operating the Cloud” aims to be a platform for productive discussions of innovative ideas, visions, and upcoming technologies in the field of cloud operation and administration. In this workshop proceedings the results of the second HPI cloud symposium "Operating the Cloud" 2014 are published. We thank the authors for exciting presentations and insights into their current work and research. Moreover, we look forward to more interesting submissions for the upcoming symposium in 2015.
