Biological Physics : Poincaré Seminar 2009 ; [This new volume of the Poincaré Seminar Series, entitled Biological Physicsʺ, corresponds to the twelfth such seminar, held on January 31, 2009]
The book contains articles from leading experts in different areas of biophysics. Topics ranging from cell dynamics to the evolution of multicellularity to conscious versus non-conscious evidence accumulation are reviewed and discussed, both from a theoretical and an experimental perspective. Furthermore, current developments of practical applications like magnetic tweezers for the study of DNA replication and brain imaging are presented.
