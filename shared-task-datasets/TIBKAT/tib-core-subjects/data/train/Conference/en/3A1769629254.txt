Resilient design and construction of geostructures against natural hazards : proceedings of the 6th GeoChina International Conference on Civil & Transportation Infrastructures: From Engineering to Smart & Green Life Cycle Solutions - Nanchang, China, 2021
This volume contains state of the engineering practice and recent research in the field of built infrastructure and natural hazards. It is expected that the book will help engineers and researchers to design and built resilient infrastructures in challenging conditions (e.g., earthquakes and climate change) while optimising the design and minimising the future maintenance cost. In particular new design and construction techniques with reference to major infrastructure projects such as tunneling and transport infrastructure are discussed.
