Biodiversity and climate change : linkages at international, national and local levels
"The diverse contributors to this substantial volume vividly illuminate the complex relationships between biodiversity and climate change, and explore potential solutions through environmental law in local, national and transnational settings. This book makes an important academic contribution towards linking legal solutions to global warming with biodiversity conservation, and it should appeal especially to scholars concerned about these issues in developing countries."--Benjamin J. Richardson, University of British Columbia, Canada. 'Today, climate change is already highly impacting on biodiversity. This adds to existing stress on biodiversity. Current extinction rates are unprecedented in history. This book addresses the many legal issues involved from a variety of perspectives by a range of esteemed authors from around the world. It does so in a positive way; aimed at finding solutions. This book greatly contributes to really addressing biodiversity loss by proposing new and innovative approaches.' - Jonathan Verschuuren, Tilburg University, The Netherlands. This insightful book deals with the complexity of linking biodiversity with climate change. It combines perspectives from international, national and local case studies, and also addresses this question using a thematic approach. The book focuses on a number of key topics and examples, including: ecosystem services, human rights, MEA clustering, equity in ABS and REDD, forestation and deforestation, biosecurity, protected areas, mountain biodiversity, the Amazon rainforest, agricultural policy in the EU and patent licensing. Clearly demonstrating linkages between biodiversity law and climate change law and stimulating new ideas for future research, this book will be a valuable reference tool for academics, researchers, students and policy-makers
