mODa 6 — Advances in Model-Oriented Design and Analysis : Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Model-Oriented Design and Analysis held in Puchberg/Schneeberg, Austria, June 25–29, 2001
The volume contains the proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Model-Oriented Design and Analysis, within a series of workshops that initially had the purpose of bringing together leading scientists from Eastern and Western Europs for the exchange of ideas in theoretical and applied statistics, with special emphasis on experimental design. The participants of these workshops have developed into a community with a range of common interests that are centred around the theory and applications of optimum design of experiments. In addition to this, the volume contains a series of special papers on topics from medical and pharmaceutical statistics.
