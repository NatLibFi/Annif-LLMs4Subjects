Comparative genomics : 19th International Conference, RECOMB-CG 2022, La Jolla, CA, USA, May 20â€“21, 2022, proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 19th Annual RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics, RECOMB-CG which took place in La Jolla, USA, during May 20-21, 2022. The 18 full papers included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 28 submissions. The papers were organized in topical sections on evolution; phylogenetics; homology and reconciliation; genome rearrangements; metagenomics; and genomic sequencing. .
