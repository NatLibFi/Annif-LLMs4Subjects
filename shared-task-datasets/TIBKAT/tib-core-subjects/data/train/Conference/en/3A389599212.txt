This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Second International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning, IJCAR 2004, held in Cork, Ireland, in July 2004. IJCAR 2004 comprises CADE, CALCULEMUS, , FroCoS, FTP, and TABLEAUX. The 26 revised full research papers and 6 revised system demonstrations presented together with 3 invited papers and a summary of a systems competition were carefully reviewed and selected from a total of 86 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on rewriting, saturation-based theorem proving, combination techniques, verification and systems, reasoning with finite structure, tableaux and non-classical logics, applications and systems, computer mathematics, interactive theorem proving, combinatorial reasoning, and higher-order reasoning
