Unified field mechanics II : formulations and empirical tests : proceedings of the Xth Symposium Honoring Noted French Mathematical Physicist Jean-Pierre Vigier, Porto Novo, Italy, 25-28 July 2016
"Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson -- controversial pioneering work on physics and biological organization. 1st conference series in history on Unified Field Mechanics, coining the term and others such as 'semi-quantum limit'. New treatment on Topological Field Theory which appears to be formalizing used to describe '3rd regime physics'. Numerous other chapters on leading edge theoretical physics"--
