This book presents the state of the art in software visualization and thus attempts to establish it as a field on its own. Based on a seminar held at Dagstuhl Castle in May 2001, the book offers topical sections on: - algorithm animation - software visualization and software engineering - software visualization and education - graphs in software visualization - and perspectives of software visualization. Each section starts with an introduction surveying previous and current work and providing extensive bibliographies.
