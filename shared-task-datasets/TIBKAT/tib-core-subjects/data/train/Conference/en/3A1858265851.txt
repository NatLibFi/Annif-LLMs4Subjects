Future developments in explosives and energetics : 1st International Explosives Conference
The International Explosives Conference (IEC) champions cutting-edge, deep-science research conducted internationally in the energetic materials sector. Designed for professionals, academics and researchers, it is involved in the fundamental science of explosives and other energetic materials. Set firmly in the context of future developments, IEC-2022 presents and debates the themes of: energetic materials and characterisation; manufacturing and processing; response to stimuli; advances in experimental techniques and diagnostics and theory, modelling and simulation. IEC-2022 took place in London from 22 to 24 June 2022 and this publication provides a record of the proceedings for the oral presentations and display posters that were showcased at the event
