Nonlinear Stochastic PDEs : Hydrodynamic Limit and Burgersâ€™ Turbulence
This volume is a based on recent research which focuses on the area of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. The first section contains work on fundamental problems of hydrodynamic limit for particle systems and on random media. The second part groups together papers under the umbrella of the name "Burgers' turbulence", although a broader spectrum of stochastic problem for the Burgers' equation is actually addressed. Finally, the last part deals with the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation both from mathematical and physical perspective. This book is suitable for mathematicians and students
