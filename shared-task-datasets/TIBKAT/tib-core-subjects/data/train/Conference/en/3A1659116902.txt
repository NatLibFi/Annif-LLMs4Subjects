Progress in Photon Science : Basics and Applications
This book features chapters based on lectures presented by world-leading researchers of photon science from Russia and Japan at the first “STEPS Symposium on Photon Science” held in Tokyo in March 2015. It describes recent progress in the field of photon science, covering a wide range of interest to experts in the field, including laser-plasma interaction, filamentation and its applications, laser assisted electron scattering, exotic properties of light, ultrafast imaging, molecules and clusters in intense laser fields, photochemistry and spectroscopy of novel materials, laser-assisted material synthesis, and photon technology.
Laser-Plasma Interaction -- Filamentation and Its Applications -- Laser-Assisted Electron Scattering -- Exotic Properties of Light -- Imaging -- Molecules and Clusters in Intense Laser Fields -- Ultracold Molecules and High-Resolution Spectroscopy -- Photochemistry and Spectroscopy of Novel Materials -- Laser-Assisted Material Synthesis and Modifications, and Coherent Photon Technology.
