"ICOLS features the latest developments in the area of laser spectroscopy and related topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics and other disciplines. The talks covered a broad range of exciting physics, such as precision tests of fundamental symmetries with atoms and molecules, atomic clocks, quantum many-body physics with ultra-cold atoms, atom interferometry, quantum information science with photons and ions, quantum optics, and ultra-fast atomic and molecular dynamics. The conference program comprised 14 sessions with 9 keynote addresses, 25 invited talks, and 3 hot topic talks. The speakers came from 15 different countries. Ever since the ICOLS conference series originated in 1973, its proceedings have been highly valued by many for capturing important developments in the field and offering the room to represent various aspects of specific research topics. The present volume contains some of the invited talks delivered at the conference"--
