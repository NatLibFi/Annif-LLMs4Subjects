Supernova 1987A 30 years later - cosmic rays and nuclei from supernovae and their aftermaths : proceedings of the 331st symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Saint-Gilles-les-Bains, La RÃ©union Island, France, February 20-24, 2017
The cataclysmic stellar explosion SN 1987A, visible to the naked eye, was the nearest and brightest supernova witnessed since the invention of the telescope four centuries ago. This volume deals with supernovae and their remnants, in terms of exceptional phenomena that produce and release high-energy nuclei and particles. Marking the thirtieth anniversary of SN 1987A, the proceedings of IAU Symposium 331 introduce our accumulating knowledge on these central sources in many active fields of investigation: stellar evolution and the diversity of supernova progenitors and their properties, explosive nucleosynthesis and particle acceleration in the most extreme environments known to physics, and the long-standing issues about the origins of heavy nuclei in the Universe and cosmic rays. Through its interdisciplinary approach, this volume also sheds light on the open issues related to these topics and emphasizes topics of future interest with upcoming multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities--Publisher's description
