Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XIX
These are the proceedings of the 19th international conference on domain decomposition methods in science and engineering. Domain decomposition methods are iterative methods for solving the often very large linear or nonlinear systems of algebraic equations that arise in various problems in mathematics, computational science, engineering and industry. They are designed for massively parallel computers and take the memory hierarchy of such systems into account. This is essential for approaching peak floating point performance. There is an increasingly well-developed theory which is having a direct impact on the development and improvement of these algorithms.
