Quantum Gravity : Mathematical Models and Experimental Bounds
This book provides the reader with an overview of the different mathematical attempts to quantize gravity written by leading experts in this field. Also discussed are the possible experimental bounds on quantum gravity effects. The contributions have been strictly refereed and are written in an accessible style. The present volume emerged from the 2nd Blaubeuren Workshop 'Mathematical and Physical Aspects of Quantum Gravity'.
"The construction of a quantum theory of gravity is the most fundamental challenge confronting contemporary theoretical physics. The different physical ideas evolved in developing a theory of quantum gravity require highly advanced mathematical methods. This book provides the reader with an overview of the different mathematical attempts to quantize gravity written by leading experts in this field. Also discussed are the possible experimental bounds on quantum gravity effects. All of the contributions have been strictly refereed. The present volume emerged from the 2nd Blaubeuren Workshop ""Mathematical and Physical Aspects of Quantum Gravity''. In general, these Workshops are intended to bring together experts in mathematics and physics to discuss in an open atmosphere the fundamental questions at the frontier of theoretical physics."
