Decoherence and Entropy in Complex Systems : Selected Lectures from DICE 2002
The contributions to this volume are based on selected lectures from the first international workshop on decoherence, information, complexity and entropy (DICE). These&nbsp;contributions reflect and acknowledge the growing importance of&nbsp;common concepts behind seemingly different fields such as quantum mechanics, general relativity and statistical physics in a form accessible to nonspecialist researchers.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;of the presentations&nbsp;include original results, which are published here for the first time. &nbsp
