Differential Geometry : Proceedings of the Nordic Summer School held in Lyngby, Denmark Jul. 29â€“Aug. 9, 1985
The Nordic Summer School 1985 presented to young researchers the mathematical aspects of the ongoing research stemming from the study of field theories in physics and the differential geometry of fibre bundles in mathematics. The volume includes papers, often with original lines of attack, on twistor methods for harmonic maps, the differential geometric aspects of Yang-Mills theory, complex differential geometry, metric differential geometry and partial differential equations in differential geometry. Most of the papers are of lasting value and provide a good introduction to their subject
