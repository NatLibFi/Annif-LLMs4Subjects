Recurrence Plots and Their Quantifications: Expanding Horizons : Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Recurrence Plots, Grenoble, France, 17-19 June 2015
Torwards visual analytics for the exploration of large sets of time series -- Applications of transient signal analysis concept of recurrence plot analysis -- Multi-lag phase diagram analysis for transient signal characterization -- Analysis of non-stationary signals by recurrence dissimilarity -- New insights for testing linearity and complexity with surrogates: a Recurrence Plot approach -- Approximate recurrence quantification analysis (aRQA) in code of best practice -- Splayed recurrence analysis of iterated dynamical systems.
The chapters in this book originate from the research work and contributions presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Recurrence Plots held in Grenoble, France in June 2015. Scientists from numerous disciplines gathered to exchange knowledge on recent applications and developments in recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis. This meeting was remarkable because of the obvious expansion of recurrence strategies (theory) and applications (practice) into ever-broadening fields of science. It discusses real-world systems from various fields, including mathematics, strange attractors, applied physics, physiology, medicine, environmental and earth sciences, as well as psychology and linguistics. Even readers not actively researching any of these particular systems will benefit from discovering how other scientists are finding practical non-linear solutions to specific problems. The book is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience of recurrence plot users and researchers interested in time series analysis in particular, and in complex systems in general.
