Charter of the new urbanism : [region - neighborhood, district, and corridor - block, street, and building]
In 1993, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was formed to foster a vision for restoring balance to cities and suburbs. The CNU approach is based upon the best traditions of urbanism, updated for modern needs. "Charter of the New Urbanism" amplifies this movement's revolutionary approach to the ways regions are designed, built, and managed. "Charter" reveals CNU's strategies and techniques to shape development constructively.
