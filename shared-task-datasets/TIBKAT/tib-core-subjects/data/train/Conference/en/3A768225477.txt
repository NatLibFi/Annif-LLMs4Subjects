Monitoring, simulation, prevention and remediation of dense and debris flows IV : [ fourth international conference on monitoring, simulation,prevention and remediation of dense and debris flows]/ Wessex Institute of Technology ... Eds. D. de Wrachien ...
"Containing papers presented at the fourth in a series of biennial International Conferences dealing with the Monitoring, Simulation, Prevention and Remediation of Dense and Debris Flows, this book addresses the need for a better understanding of the ever more frequent phenomena known as debris flows. Due to the increased occurrence of debris and hyper-concentrated flows and the impact they have on both the environment and human life, these extreme events and the related processes have been attracting increased attention from research groups and land planning and management professionals. A full understanding of these phenomena will lead to an integrated risk management approach that can include measures to prevent a hazard turning into a disaster"--Page 4 of cover
