The astrophysics of planetary systems: formation, structure, and dynamical evolution : proceedings of the 276th symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Torino, Italy, October 10 - 15, 2010
This volume provides a detailed snapshot of the state-of-the-art of the field fifteen years after the first extrasolar planet discovery announcement. The major review articles and contributed papers allow for vibrant discussions and confrontations between theory and observations. Datasets of the highest quality, innovative numerical tools and increasingly sophisticated theoretical models show the impressive progress being made in our understanding of planet formation and evolution, heralding the era of 'comparative planetology' as a new, expanding interdisciplinary research field. IAU S276 also examines the strategic planning exercises of both the science community and space agencies and ongoing preparations and developments of future ground-based and space-borne observatories devoted to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets. This stimulating volume constitutes an important reference for both young scientists and seasoned researchers, who will contribute to the frontier of research in the field during the next decade. -- Back cover
