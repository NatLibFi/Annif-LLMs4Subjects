On April 25-27, 1989, over a hundred mathematicians, including eleven from abroad, gathered at the University of Illinois Conference Center at Allerton Park for a major conference on analytic number theory. The occa­ sion marked the seventieth birthday and impending (official) retirement of Paul T. Bateman, a prominent number theorist and member of the mathe­ matics faculty at the University of Illinois for almost forty years. For fifteen of these years, he served as head of the mathematics department. The conference featured a total of fifty-four talks, including ten in­ vited lectures by H. Delange, P. Erdos, H. Iwaniec, M. Knopp, M. Mendes France, H. L. Montgomery, C. Pomerance, W. Schmidt, H. Stark, and R. C. Vaughan. This volume represents the contents of thirty of these talks as well as two further contributions. The papers span a wide range of topics in number theory, with a majority in analytic number theory.
