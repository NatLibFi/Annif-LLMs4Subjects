Evolutionary computation in combinatorial optimization : 4th European Conference, EvoCOP 2004, Coimbra, Portugal, April 5 - 7, 2004 ; proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings for the 4th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization, EvoCOP 2004, held in Coimbra, Portugal, in April together with EuroGP 2004 and six workshops on evolutionary computing. The 23 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 86 submissions. Among the topics addressed are evolutionary algorithms as well as metaheuristics like memetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and scatter search; the papers are dealing with representations, operators, search spaces, adaptation, comparison of algorithms, hybridization of different methods, and theory. Among the combinatorial optimization problems studied are graph coloring, network design, cutting, packing, scheduling, timetabling, traveling salesman, vehicle routing, and various other real-world applications
