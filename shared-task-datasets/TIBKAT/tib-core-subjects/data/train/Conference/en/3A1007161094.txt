Fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere : proceedings of the 327th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, October 9-14, 2016
"The main scientific goal of this Symposium was to discuss recent results on the processes shaping the structure of the solar atmosphere and driving plasma eruptions and explosive events. The Symposium brought together researchers, in both theory and observation, who study structure and activity in the solar atmosphere to discuss the range of topics in the field...This volume will be useful to senior and new researchers studying solar and stellar atmospheres and activity, sunspots and starspots, exoplanetary systems, and developing advanced observational techniques and theoretical models." -- Preface
