11th International Conference on Analysis and Optimization of Systems Discrete Event Systems : Sophia-Antipolis, June 15-16-17, 1994
The conference, coorganized by INRIA and Ecole des Mines de Paris, focuses on Discrete Event Systems (DES) and is aimed at engineers, scientists and mathematicians working in the fields of Automatic Control, Operations Research and Statistics who are interested in the modelling, analysis and optimization of DES. Various methods such as Automata theory, Petri nets, etc. are proposed to describe and analyze such systems. Comparison of these different mathematical approaches and the global confrontation of theoretical approaches with applications in manufacturing, telecommunications, parallel computing, transportation, etc. are the goals of the conference
