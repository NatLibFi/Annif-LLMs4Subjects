mODa 9 â€“ Advances in Model-Oriented Design and Analysis : Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop in Model-Oriented Design and Analysis held in Bertinoro, Italy, June 14-18, 2010
The volume contains the proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Model-Oriented Design and Analysis. It offers leading and pioneering work on optimal experimental designs, both from a theoretical point of view and in respect of real applications. Scientists from Eastern and Western Europe, the US, Asia and Africa, are contributors to this volume. Designs for nonlinear models, for discriminating between models, for multivariate data and for applications to medicine are some of the primary topics covered.
