Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization. Algorithms and Techniques : 7th International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, APPROX 2004, and 8th International Workshop on Randomization and Computation, RANDOM 2004, Cambridge, MA, USA, August 22-24, 2004. Proceedings
This book constitutes the joint refereed proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, APPROX 2004 and the 8th International Workshop on Randomization and Computation, RANDOM 2004, held in Cambridge, MA, USA in August 2004. The 37 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 87 submissions. Among the issues addressed are design and analysis of approximation algorithms, inapproximability results, approximation classes, online problems, graph algorithms, cuts, geometric computations, network design and routing, packing and covering, scheduling, game theory, design and analysis of randomised algorithms, randomized complexity theory, pseudorandomness, derandomization, probabilistic proof systems, error-correcting codes, and other applications of approximation and randomness
