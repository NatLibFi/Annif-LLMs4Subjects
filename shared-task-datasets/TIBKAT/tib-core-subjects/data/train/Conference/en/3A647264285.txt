User-centric technologies and applications : proceedings of the Contexts 2011 Workshop
"'Context' is devined as 'any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity'. Nowadays, the increasing availability of communication networks, the miniaturization and progressive reduction in the cost of sensors and the penetration of advanced mobile personal devices make possible to collect and process data from multiple sources and combine them in order to automatically infer knowledge about the user's situation. Thus, the CONTEXTS Workshop aims at gathering advances on key elements that enable the design and deployment of personalized ubiquitous context-aware services and natural non-intrusive methods for interaction."--Back cover
