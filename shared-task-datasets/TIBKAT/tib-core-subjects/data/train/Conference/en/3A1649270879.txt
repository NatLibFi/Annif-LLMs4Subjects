This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics, TPHOLs 2002, held in Hampton, VA, USA in August 2002. The 20 revised full papers presented together with 2 invited contributions were carefully reviewed and selected from 34 submissions. All current issues in HOL theorem proving and formal verification of software and hardware systems are addressed. Among the HOL theorem proving systems evaluated are Isabelle/HOL, Isabelle/Isar, and Coq
