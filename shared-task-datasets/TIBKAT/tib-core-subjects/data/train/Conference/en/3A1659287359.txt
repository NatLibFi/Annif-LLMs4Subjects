Schubert varieties, equivariant cohomology and characteristic classes : Impanga 15
IMPANGA stands for the activities of Algebraic Geometers at the Institute of Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences, including one of the most important seminars in algebraic geometry in Poland. The topics of the lectures usually fit within the framework of complex algebraic geometry and neighboring areas of mathematics. This volume is a collection of contributions by the participants of the conference IMPANGA15, organized by participants of the seminar, as well as notes from the major lecture series of the seminar in the period 2010-2015. Both original research papers and self-contained expository surveys can be found here. The articles circulate around a broad range of topics within algebraic geometry such as vector bundles, Schubert varieties, degeneracy loci, homogeneous spaces, equivariant cohomology, Thom polynomials, characteristic classes, symmetric functions and polynomials, and algebraic geometry in positive characteristic
