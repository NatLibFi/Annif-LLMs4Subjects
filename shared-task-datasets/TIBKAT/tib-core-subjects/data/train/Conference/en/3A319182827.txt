Analytical ultracentrifugation V : [... this meeting was continued on March 25 - 26, 1999 with the 11th Symposium organized by the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces at the University of Potsdam]
The basis for this volume is the 11th Symposium on Analytical Ultracentrifugation held in March 25-26, 1999 at the University of Potsdam, Germany. This book presents a comprehensive collection of 33 contributions from leading scientists in this field including: Technical and methodological innovations.- Innovations in data analysis.- Hydrodynamics/Modelling.- Synthetic polymers, colloids and supramolecular systems.- Biological systems.- Interacting systems and assemblies. In contrast to the increasing significance of analytical ultracentrifugation, related modern books are very rare. Therefore, this volume will be a helpful source of information to anyone who wants to catch up with the most recent developments and results related to this important analytical method
