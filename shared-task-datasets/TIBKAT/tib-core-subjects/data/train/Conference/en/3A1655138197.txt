Stochastic Mechanics and Stochastic Processes : Proceedings of a Conference held in Swansea, U.K., Aug. 4â€“8, 1986
The main theme of the meeting was to illustrate the use of stochastic processes in the study of topological problems in quantum physics and statistical mechanics. Much discussion of current problems was generated and there was a considerable amount of interaction between mathematicians and physicists. The papers presented in the proceedings are essentially of a research nature but some (Lewis, Hudson) are introductions or surveys
