This book presents a critical analysis of the role of international institutions and their performance in terms of justification, effectiveness and efficiency. The authors begin by discussing the controversies surrounding the Tobin Tax in the context of global governance. They move on to address important global issues where international institutions play a significant role. These include trade and FDI in relation to the WTO, and the reconciliation of order and justice in the international trading system. Further chapters investigate development issues and international institutions, most of which were not designed for the specific needs of developing countries. They assess whether international institutions can actually help to mitigate the tendency of uneven development in the global economy. Finally, the focus switches to the analysis and evaluation of one specific institution and its actions, namely, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
