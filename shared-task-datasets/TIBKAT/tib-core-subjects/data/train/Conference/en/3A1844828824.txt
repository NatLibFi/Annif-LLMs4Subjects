Left atrial and scar quantification and segmentation : first challenge, LAScarQS 2022, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2022, Singapore, September 18, 2022 : proceedings
This book constitutes the First Left Atrial and Scar Quantification and Segmentation Challenge, LAScarQS 2022, which was held in conjunction with the 25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2022, in Singapore, in September 2022. The 15 papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected form numerous submissions. The aim of the challenge is not only benchmarking various LA scar segmentation algorithms, but also covering the topic of general cardiac image segmentation, quantification, joint optimization, and model generalization, and raising discussions for further technical development and clinical deployment
