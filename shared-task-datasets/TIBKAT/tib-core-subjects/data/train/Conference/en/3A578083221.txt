3D geo-information sciences : [selected from the Third Workshop on 3D Geo-Information, 13 - 14 November, Seoul, Korea]
"The book contains papers that focus explicitly on the last achievements (methods, algorithms, models, systems) with respect to the Third Dimension. Motivated by the rapid developments in 3D, the organised workshop aims at attracting the best world-wide research in the following areas: 3D geo information requirements (based on analysis of applications), 3D data acquisition and processing (LiDAR, Photogrammetry), 3D object reconstruction, 3D spatial data models (vector, voxel, CSG, tetrahedrons, curved surfaces, etc.), 3D GIS and time, 3D in spatial databases, 3D topology and network, 3D visualization, Augmented and Virtual Reality, 3D spatial analysis and simulation, 3D Indoor/Outdoor Navigation, 3D and levels of detail (scale/resolution), 3D City Model and Building Model (outdoor and indoor integration), 3D applications (3D cadastre, 3D utilities, 3D city and urban planning modeling, etc. ), 3D standards." "The papers are organized in three parts as follows: Data acquisition and processing: advanced approaches for 3D data collection, processing and methods for real-time data acquisition - Data modelling and management: topological, geometrical and network models for representation and maintenance of 3D geo-information in geographical multi-scales - Data analysis and visualization: frameworks for representing 3D spatial relationships, 3D spatial analysis and algorithms for indoor/outdoor navigation, interpolation, etc. Advanced Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality visualization."--BOOK JACKET.--
