Irreversible Quantum Dynamics
This set of tutorial reviews is dedicated to all aspects of irreversibility and time asymmetry in quantum mechanics. The main themes addressed are: - theoretical aspects of quantum irreversible dynamics - open quantum systems and applications - foundational aspects of irreversible quantum dynamics - asymmetric time evolution and resonances &nbsp;This volume will benefit graduate students and researchers looking for a readable account of the current status of the field. It is also suited for lecturers looking for advanced material for their courses and seminars
