Nanomaterials for application in medicine and biology : [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Nanomaterials for Application in Medicine and Biology, Bonn, Germany, 4 - 6 October 2006]
The wide range of possibilities as well as the increasing importance of nanomaterials in medicine has become apparent in today's world. This book unites the multi-faceted work of international scientists from the domains of physics, chemistry, and biomedicine, as they cooperate to present the role and application of such nanomaterials in modern medicine with particular emphasis on cell growth, manipulation, and modification. Not only does this book provide the reader with the necessary theoretical background information, it also gives valuable experimental data, thus allowing for an exact comp
