High Performance Scientific And Engineering Computing : Proceedings of the 3rd International FORTWIHR Conference on HPSEC, Erlangen, March 12â€“14, 2001
The book is a state-of-the-art overview on high performance computing (HPC) activities to solve scientific and/or engineering problems on supercomputers. This topic has evolved to a key technology playing an important role in determining, or at least shaping, future research and development activities in many branches of industry. The main topics include the development of advanced numerical methods, parallel computing techniques, grid generation, and visualization. Applications of these techniques are directed to fluid dynamics, turbulence, combustion and porous media related flows, computational structural dynamics, material sciences, chemical engineering, dynamic systems, optimal control, and optimization of electronic circuits. The book includes 44 contributions from renowned international experts in the field of HPC and its applications
