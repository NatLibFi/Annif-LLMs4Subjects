Affine Algebraic Geometry : proceedings of the Conference, Osaka, Japan 3 - 6 March 2011 ; [held at Osaka Umeda Campus of Kwansei Gakuin University ... on the occasion of the seventieth birthday of Professor Masayoshi Miyanishi]
The present volume grew out of an international conference on affine algebraic geometry held in Osaka, Japan during 3-6 March 2011 and is dedicated to Professor Masayoshi Miyanishi on the occasion of his 70th birthday. It contains 16 refereed articles in the areas of affine algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and related fields, which have been the working fields of Professor Miyanishi for almost 50 years. Readers will be able to find recent trends in these areas too. The topics contain both algebraic and analytic, as well as both affine and projective, problems. All the results treated in this volume are new and original which subsequently will provide fresh research problems to explore. This volume is suitable for graduate students and researchers in these areas -- P. 4 of cover
