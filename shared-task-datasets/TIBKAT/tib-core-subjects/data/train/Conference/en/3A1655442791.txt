Advances in Software Tools for Scientific Computing
This book concerns programming techniques like object-oriented programming and generic (template) programming. These modern techniques have proven to increase flexibility, modularization, code reuse and improve maintenance of large numerical codes. The book contains 11 refereed and comprehensive chapters on major subjects in computational science and engineering: quality measurement of numerical software, high-performance numerical computations with C++ without sacrificing efficiency, a balanced discussion of Java in scientific computing, object-oriented design of direct sparse solvers, geometric kernels in geographical information systems, and tools for error estimation in finite element methods, tools for validating computational results, and how to simplify the implementation of highly complex mathematical model for material processing
