Cosmic Rays in Star-Forming Environments : Proceedings of the Second Session of the Sant Cugat Forum on Astrophysics
These are the proceedings of the Sant Cugat Forum 2nd Workshop on Cosmic-ray Induced Phenomenology in Stellar Environments, held April 16-19, 2012. The aim of this Workshop was to address the current knowledge and challenges of high-energy emission from stellar environments at all scales and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the field from the observational to the theoretical perspectives. In the meeting, the prospects for possible observations with planned instruments across the multi-wavelength spectrum were analyzed and also how they impact on our understanding of these systems
