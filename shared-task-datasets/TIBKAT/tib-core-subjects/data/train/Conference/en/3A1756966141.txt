New Sinc Methods of Numerical Analysis : Festschrift in Honor of Frank Stenger's 80th Birthday
This contributed volume honors the 80th birthday of Frank Stenger who established new Sinc methods in numerical analysis.The contributions, written independently from each other, show the new developments in numerical analysis in connection with Sinc methods and approximations of solutions for differential equations, boundary value problems, integral equations, integrals, linear transforms, eigenvalue problems, polynomial approximations, computations on polyhedra, and many applications. The approximation methods are exponentially converging compared with standard methods and save resources in computation. They are applicable in many fields of science including mathematics, physics, and engineering.The ideas discussed serve as a starting point in many different directions in numerical analysis research and applications which will lead to new and unprecedented results. This book will appeal to a wide readership, from students to specialized experts.
