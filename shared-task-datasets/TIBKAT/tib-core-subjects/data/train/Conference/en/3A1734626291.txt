Operator Algebras, Toeplitz Operators and Related Topics
This book features a collection of up-to-date research papers that study various aspects of general operator algebra theory and concrete classes of operators, including a range of applications. Most of the papers included were presented at the International Workshop on Operator Algebras, Toeplitz Operators, and Related Topics, in Boca del Rio, Veracruz, Mexico, in November 2018. The conference, which was attended by more than 30 leading experts in the field, was held in celebration of Nikolai Vasilevski’s 70th birthday, and the contributions are dedicated to him.
