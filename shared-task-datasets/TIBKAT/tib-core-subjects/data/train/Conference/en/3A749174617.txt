Integrability of Nonlinear Systems
The lectures that comprise this volume constitute a comprehensive survey of the many and various aspects of integrable dynamical systems. The present edition is a streamlined, revised and updated version of a 1997 set of notes that was published as Lecture Notes in Physics, Volume 495. This volume will be complemented by a companion book dedicated to discrete integrable systems. Both volumes address primarily graduate students and nonspecialist researchers but will also benefit lecturers looking for suitable material for advanced courses and researchers interested in specific topics
