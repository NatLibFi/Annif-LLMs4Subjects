Fluids under control : the 2021 Prague-Sum workshop lectures
This volume presents state-of-the-art developments in theoretical and applied fluid mechanics. Chapters are based on lectures given at a workshop in the summer school Fluids under Control, held in Prague on August 25, 2021. Readers will find a thorough analysis of current research topics, presented by leading experts in their respective fields. Specific topics covered include: Magnetohydrodynamic systems, The steady Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, Boussinesq equations, Fluid-structure-acoustic interactions. Fluids under Control will be a valuable resource for students interested in mathematical fluid mechanics.
