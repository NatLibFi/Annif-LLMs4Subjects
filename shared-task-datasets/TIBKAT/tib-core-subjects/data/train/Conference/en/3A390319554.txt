Scientific computing in electrical engineering : proceedings of the SCEE 2002 Conference, held in Eindhoven, [from 23rd to 28th June 2002]
This book presents the proceedings of the 4th International Workshop "Scientific Computing in Electrical Engineering", held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, from June 23-28, 2002. This workshop followed three earlier workshops held in 1997 at the Darmstadt University of Technology, in 1998 at the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, and in 2000 at the University of Rostock. The main topics of SCEE-2002 were computational electrodynamics, circuit simulation and coupled problems. The objective of the workshop, which was mainly directed at mathematicians and electrical engineers, was to bring together scientists from universities and industry with the goal of intensive discussions about modelling and numerical simulation of electronic circuits and electromagnetic fields. A special feature was the "Industry Day", where distinguished speakers discussed the needs of industry in the field of computational electromagnetics and circuit simulation. The book contains papers of invited and contributed talks, as well as from poster presentations
