Importance of Growth for Health and Development : 65th Nestl√© Nutrition Institute Workshop, Pediatric Program, Kuala Lumpur, March 2009
Growth is universally used by health care professionals and caregivers to judge the physical condition of babies and children: poor growth in early life has a negative impact on cognitive development and morbidity, whereas rapid and excessive growth is associated with a higher prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular disease. This publication explores in some detail the relationship between early growth patterns and later neurodevelopment, obesity, cardiovascular outcomes and longevity in both industrialized and semi-industrialized societies. It consists of three parts that each deals with a specific topic: The first part focuses on the connection between early growth and obesity and cardiovascular outcomes. The next section concentrates on the interrelationship between growth and neurological development, and the last part is dedicated to the control and assessment of physical growth.Bringing together the expert opinions of outstanding clinicians and scientists, this book will be of particular value for pediatricians, public health scientists and epidemiologists
