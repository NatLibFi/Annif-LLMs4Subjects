Holomorphic Dynamical Systems : Cetraro, Italy, July 7-12, 2008
The theory of holomorphic dynamical systems is a subject of increasing interest in mathematics, both for its challenging problems and for its connections with other branches of pure and applied mathematics. This volume collects the Lectures held at the 2008 CIME session on "Holomorphic Dynamical Systems" held in Cetraro, Italy. This CIME Course focused on a number of important topics in the study of discrete and continuous dynamical systems, including both local and global aspects, providing a fascinating introduction to many key problems in current research. The contributions provide an ample description of the phenomena occurring in central themes of holomorphic dynamics such as automorphisms and meromorphic self-maps of projective spaces, of entire maps on complex spaces and holomorphic foliations in surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds, elaborating on the different techniques used and familiarizing readers with the latest findings on current research topics.
