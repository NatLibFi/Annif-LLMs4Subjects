Relaxin and Related Peptides
This comprehensive book contains the latest information on diverse biological functions of relaxin and related peptide found since the recent discovery of relaxin receptors. It also describes the evolution of relaxin family peptides and their receptors, molecular mechanisms of ligand/receptor interaction and the analysis of activated signaling pathways.
Relaxin and Related Peptides discusses the established paradigms, the contradictions, and the most recent findings and future directions in the field of relaxin research. The array of diverse topics are highlighted, ranging from evolution of relaxin family peptides and receptors to their cell signaling, from the role of relaxin in reproduction to the newly discovered functions in cancer progression and in the nervous system. This book includes chapters written by well-known experts in the relaxin field who are actively involved in shaping this rapidly evolving science. The four major ongoing areas of research described in this book will likely attract investigators for years to come, since many basic scientific questions remain unanswered at this time. The availability of structural databases, new experimental techniques, and high quality hormone preparations, antibodies and other reagents enable rigorous investigation. Relaxin and Related Peptides offers a fresh perspective along with different points of view, opinions and disagreements.
