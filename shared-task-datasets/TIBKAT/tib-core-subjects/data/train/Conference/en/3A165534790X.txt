Advances in Convex Analysis and Global Optimization : Honoring the Memory of C. Caratheodory (1873â€“1950)
There has been much recent progress in global optimization algorithms for nonconvex continuous and discrete problems from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. Convex analysis plays a fundamental role in the analysis and development of global optimization algorithms. This is due to the fact that virtually all nonconvex optimization problems can be described using differences of convex functions and differences of convex sets. A conference on Convex Analysis and Global Optimization was held June 5-9, 2000 at Pythagorian, Samos, Greece. It was in honor of the memory of C. Caratheodory (1873-1950). It was endorsed by the Mathematical Programming Society (MPS) and by the Society for industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAN) Activity Group in Optimization. This volume contains a selection of refereed papers based on invited and contributing talks presented at the conference. The two themes of convexity and global optimization pervade the book. The conference provided a forum for researchers working on different aspects of convexity and global optimization to present their recent discoveries, and to interact with people working on complementary aspects of mathematical programming. Audience: Faculty, graduate students, and researchers in mathematical programming, computer science, and engineering
