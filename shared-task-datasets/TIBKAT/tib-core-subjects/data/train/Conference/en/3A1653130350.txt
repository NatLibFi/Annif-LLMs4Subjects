This book collects papers mainly presented at the "International Conference on Partial Differential Equations: Theory, Control and Approximation" (May 28 to June 1, 2012 in Shanghai) in honor of the scientific legacy of the exceptional mathematician Jacques-Louis Lions. The contributors are leading experts from all over the world, including members of the Academies of Sciences in France, the USA and China etc., and their papers cover key fields of research, e.g. partial differential equations, control theory and numerical analysis, that Jacques-Louis Lions created or contributed so much to establishing
