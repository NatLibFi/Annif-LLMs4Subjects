The Iron Pnictide Superconductors : An Introduction and Overview
Introduction -- Fe-based superconductors: Materials, phase diagrams, and spectroscopy -- Modeling many-body physics in Fe-superconductors and other multi-orbital materials with the Slave-Spin mean-field: Mott and Hund's physics -- Cooper-pairing, magnetic frustration, and spin fluctuations in iron-based superconductors.- Nematic order and fluctuations in iron based superconductors.
This book covers different aspects of the physics of iron-based superconductors ranging from the theoretical, the numerical and computational, to the experimental ones. It starts from the basic theory modeling many-body physics in Fe-superconductors and other multi-orbital materials and drreaches up to the magnetic and Cooper pair fluctuations and nematic order. Finally, it offers a comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements in the experimental investigations of iron based superconductors.  .
