Advances in Hypercomplex Analysis
The work aims at bringing together international leading specialists in the field of Quaternionic and Clifford Analysis, as well as young researchers interested in the subject, with the idea of presenting and discussing recent results, analyzing new trends and techniques in the area and, in general, of promoting scientific collaboration. Particular attention is paid to the presentation of different notions of regularity for functions of hypercomplex variables, and to the study of the main features of the theories that they originate.
