Agents and Computational Autonomy : Potential, Risks, and Solutions
This book originates from the First International Workshop on Computational Autonomy -Potential, Risks, Solutions, AUTONOMY 2003, held in Melbourne, Australia in July 2003 as part of AAMAS 2003. In addition to 7 revised selected workshop papers, the volume editors solicited 14 invited papers by leading researchers in the area. The workshop papers and the invited papers present a comprehensive and coherent survey of the state of the art of research on autonomy, capturing various theories of autonomy, perspectives on autonomy in different kinds of agent-based systems, and practical approaches to dealing with agent autonomy
