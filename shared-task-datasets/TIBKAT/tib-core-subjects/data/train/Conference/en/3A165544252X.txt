Computational Electromagnetics : Proceedings of the GAMM Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics, Kiel, Germany, January 26â€“28, 2001
The contributions in this book by leading international experts in the field of electromagnetic field computation cover a wide area of contemporary research activities. They clearly underline the important role of modeling, analysis and numerical methods to provide powerful tools for the simulation of electromagnetic phenomena. The main topics range from the mathematical analysis of Maxwell's equations including its proper spatial discretizations (edge elements, boundary element methods, finite integration), and efficient iterative solution techniques (multigrid, domain decomposition) to multiscale aspects in micromagnetics. The reader will get acquainted with many facets of modern computational techniques and its applications to relevant problems in electromagnetism
