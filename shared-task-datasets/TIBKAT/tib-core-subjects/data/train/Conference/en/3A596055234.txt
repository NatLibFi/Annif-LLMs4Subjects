Takaharu + Yui Tezuka, nostalgic future, erinnerte Zukunft : [to coincide with the Exhibition "Tezuka Architects - Nostalgic Future" at the Deutsches Architekturmuseum (DAM), Frankfurt, 9 May - 28 June 2009]
"It is always enjoyable to watch young architects with whom I have worked establish their own practices. Taka Tezuka worked with me for four years and then set up Tezuka Architects with his wife Yui in 1994 and today they are one of the most interesting young offices in Japan. Tezuka Architects have developed a very high standard of architecture both in functional and aesthetic terms, as one can see from their catalogue."--BOOK JACKET
