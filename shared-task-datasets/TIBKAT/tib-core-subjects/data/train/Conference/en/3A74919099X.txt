White Dwarfs : Proceedings of IAU Colloquium No. 114 Held at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA, August 15-19, 1988
This book contains the contributed papers and reviews from IAU Colloquium Number 114 on White Dwarfs held at Dartmouth College in August 1988. All the current fields of research in this area are covered including the evolution of white dwarfs, links to progenitors, luminosity functions of white dwarfs, evolution of white dwarfs in binaries, spectroscopy and atmospheric abundances, diffusion, accretion and convective mixing, the mass-radius relation, gravitational redshifts, masses of white dwarfs, and magnetic white dwarfs. Special emphasis has been placed on the intrinsic properties of single white dwarfs. All the articles are by internationally known authorities and contain the most up-to-date information available at the time of writing
