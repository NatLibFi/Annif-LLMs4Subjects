Groß Bauen : Großbaustellen als kulturgeschichtliches Phänomen
Large construction sites are not only an expression and driver of technical progress but also, as symbolic places, conveyors of political and cultural messages. In the wake of the crises affecting large current projects, such as Berlin Airport and the Hamburg Elbphilharmonie, public interest in them is currently enormous. However, this is by no means a new phenomenon. The book presented here provides--for the first time--far-reaching and comparative analyses of the history and importance of large construction sites. Using case studies from different cultural spheres and time periods, the authors discuss the multifaceted degrees of impact large buildings have during construction over the frequently long periods of their creation, and the changes in how they are perceived by society
