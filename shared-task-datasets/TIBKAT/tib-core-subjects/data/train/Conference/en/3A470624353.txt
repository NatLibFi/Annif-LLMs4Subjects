This volume contains a selection of the papers presented at the 8th Conference on Colloid Chemistry. It was hosted by the Hungarian Chemical Society and organized by Budapest University of Technology and Economics and was held in Keszthely, Hungary in September 2002. A colloidal approach to nano science was one of the main topics of the meeting. It was revealed that the colloid science provides a strong background of the modern material science and nanotechnology. This volume is intended for professionals doing fundamental research or development of industrial applications, who encounter colloid particles, colloid structures, and interface phenomena during their work.
