This collection of original papers related to the Israeli GAFA seminar (on Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis) from the years 2006 to 2011 continues the long tradition of the previous volumes, which reflect the general trends of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, understood in a broad sense, and are a source of inspiration for new research. Most of the papers deal with various aspects of the theory, including classical topics in the geometry of convex bodies, inequalities involving volumes of such bodies or more generally, logarithmically-concave measures, valuation theory, probabilistic and isoperimetric problems in the combinatorial setting, volume distribution on high-dimensional spaces and characterization of classical constructions in Geometry and Analysis (like the Legendre and Fourier transforms, derivation and others). All the papers here are original research papers
