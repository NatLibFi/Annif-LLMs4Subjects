Dilemmas of sustainable urban development : a view from practice
"Dilemmas of Sustainable Urban Development offers valuable insights into a difficult line of work whose practice inevitably requires a confrontation with fundamental conflicts between divergent goals, and therefore also demands difficult choices and compromises.

The examples in this book touch upon all aspects of sustainable urban development work, from City Hall to the local park.
