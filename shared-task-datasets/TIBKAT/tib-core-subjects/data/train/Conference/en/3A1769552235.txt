Road vehicle automation 8
This book is the eight volume of a sub-series on Road Vehicle Automation, published as part of the Lecture Notes in Mobility. Written by researchers, engineers and analysts from around the globe, the contributions are based on oral and poster presentations from the Automated Vehicles Symposium (AVS) 2020, held on July 27â€“30, 2020, as a fully virtual event. The book explores public sector activities, human factors aspects, vehicle systems and other related technological developments, as well as transportation infrastructure planning, which are expect to foster and support road vehicle automation.
