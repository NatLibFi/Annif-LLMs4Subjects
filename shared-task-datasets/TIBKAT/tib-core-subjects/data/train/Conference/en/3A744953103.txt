Boundary Control and Boundary Variations : Proceedings of the IFIP WG 7.2 Conference Nice, France, June 10-13, 1987
This volume comprises the proceedings of the Working Conference "Boundary variations and boundary control" held in Nice (France), June 10-13, 1986. The aim of this Conference was to stimulate exchange of ideas between the group working on shape optimization (including free boundary problems) and the group working on boundary control of hyperbolic systems (including stabilization). An important remark is that if one considers a dynamical system governed by linear elasticity the choice of Lagrangian coordinates leads to discuss boundary conditions, or boundary control (for example to stabilize), while the choice of Eulerian coordinates lead to a moving boundary and moving domain . This remark challenges us to consider the domain (or its boundary) as a control
