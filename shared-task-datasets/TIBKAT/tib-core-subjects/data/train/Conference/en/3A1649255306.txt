Nowadays, the Internet is the most commonly used medium for the exchange of data in di?erent forms. Presently, over 60 million machines have access to the Internet and to its resources. However, the Internet is also the largest distributed system o?ering di?erent computational services and possibilities not only for cluster computing. If the needs of modern mobile computing and multimedia systems are taken into account, it becomes clear that modern methods must ensure an e?ective development and management of the Internet allowing each user fast access to this huge resource space. The Innovative Internet Computing Systems workshop is organized by the Gesellschaft fur ¨ Informatik(GI) in Germany. It intends to be an open me- ing point for scientists dealing with di?erent aspects of this complex topic. In contrast to the Distributed Communities on the Web workshops, which can be 2 considered as the roots of I CS, special attention is given to fundamental - search works and the application of theoretical and formal results in practical implementations.
