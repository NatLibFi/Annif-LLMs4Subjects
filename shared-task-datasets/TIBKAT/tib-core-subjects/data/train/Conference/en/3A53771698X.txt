Computer vision/computer graphics collaboration techniques : third international conference, MIRAGE 2007, Rocquencourt, France, March 28-30, 2007 ; proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Third International Conference on Computer Vision/Computer Graphics collaboration techniques involving image analysis/synthesis approaches MIRAGE 2007, held in Rocquencourt, France, in March 2007.   The 55 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 198 submissions. The papers cover foundational and methodological issues such as model-based imaging and analysis, image-based modeling and 3D reconstruction, data driven animation, image and video-based lighting and rendering, model-based vision approaches, model-based indexing and database retrieval, model-based object tracking in image sequences, model-based image and shape analysis, model-based video compression techniques.  Application issues addressed are human/computer interfaces, video-games and entertainment industry, media productions from and for films, broadcasts and games, post-production, computer animation, virtual effects, realistic 3D simulation, virtual prototyping, multimedia applications, multimedia database classification, virtual and augmented reality, medical and biomedical applications.
