Topological Fixed Point Theory and Applications : Proceedings of a Conference held at the Nankai Institute of Mathematics Tianjin, PR China, April 5â€“8, 1988
This selection of papers from the Beijing conference gives a cross-section of the current trends in the field of fixed point theory as seen by topologists and analysts. Apart from one survey article, they are all original research articles, on topics including equivariant theory, extensions of Nielsen theory, periodic orbits of discrete and continuous dynamical systems, and new invariants and techniques in topological approaches to analytic problems
