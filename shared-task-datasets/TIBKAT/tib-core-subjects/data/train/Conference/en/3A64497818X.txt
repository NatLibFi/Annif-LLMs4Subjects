Advances in Ring Theory : [The International Conference on Algebra and its Applications held in Athens, Ohio, June 18-21, 2008 and sponsored by the Ohio University Center for Ring Theory and its Applications (CRA) had as its central purpose to honor Surender K. Jain, the Center&rsquo;s retiring first director, on the dual occasion of his 70th birthday and of his retirement from Ohio University]
This volume consists of refereed research and expository articles by both plenary and other speakers at the International Conference on Algebra and Applications held at Ohio University in June 2008, to honor S.K. Jain on his 70th birthday. The articles are on a wide variety of areas in classical ring theory and module theory, such as rings satisfying polynomial identities, rings of quotients, group rings, homological algebra, injectivity and its generalizations, etc. Included are also applications of ring theory to problems in coding theory and in linear algebra
