Digital and Image Geometry : Advanced Lectures
Images or discrete objects, to be analyzed based on digital image data, need to be represented, analyzed, transformed, recovered etc. These problems have stimulated many interesting developments in theoretical foundations of image processing. This coherent anthology presents 27 state-of-the-art surveys and research papers on digital image geometry and topology. It is based on a winter school held at Dagstuhl Castle, Germany in December 2000 and offers topical sections on topology, representation, geometry, multigrid convergence, and shape similarity and simplification
