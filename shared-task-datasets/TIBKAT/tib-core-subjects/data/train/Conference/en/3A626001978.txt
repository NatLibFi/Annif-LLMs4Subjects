Assuring Nuclear Safety Competence into the 21st Century : Workshop Proceedings, Budapest, Hungary 12-14 October 1999
Irrespective of current views on the future of nuclear power programmes, concerns are arising with respect to the long-term ability to preserve safety competence because student enrolments in nuclear engineering are decreasing rapidly and experienced staff are reaching retirement age. "Assuring Nuclear Safety Competence into the 21st Century" was discussed in depth by workshop participants. The need for a long-term strategic view was emphasised, and policy recommendations were made. These proceedings will be of particular interest to those playing a policy role in the nuclear industry, regulatory bodies and the education sector.
