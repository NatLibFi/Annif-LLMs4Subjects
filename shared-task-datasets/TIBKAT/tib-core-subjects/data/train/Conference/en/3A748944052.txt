Active Galactic Nuclei
Starting with this volume, the Lecture Notes of the renowned Advanced Courses of the Swiss Society for Astrophysics and Astronomy will be published annually. In each course, three extensive lectures given by leading experts in their respective fields cover different and essential aspects of the subject. The 20th course, held at Les Diablerets in April 1990, dealt with current research on active galactic nuclei; it represents the most up-to-date views on the subject, presented with particular regard for clarity. The previous courses considered a wide variety of subjects, beginning with "Theory of Stellar Athmospheres" in 1971 and ending with "The Milky Way as a Galaxy" in 1989. The Lecture Notes of these Saas-Fee Courses appeared as publications of the Geneva Observatory, from which they can still be ordered (chemin des Maillettes 51, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland)
