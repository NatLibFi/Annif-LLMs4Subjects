Dynamical Systems : Lectures given at the C.I.M.E. Summer School held in Cetraro, Italy, June 19-26, 2000
The C.I.M.E. session on Dynamical Systems, held in Cetraro (Italy), June 19-26, 2000, focused on the latest developments in several important areas in dynamical systems, with full development and historical context. The lectures of Chow and Mallet-Paret focus on the area of lattice differential systems, the lectures of Conto and Galleotti treat the classical problem of classification of orbits for two-dimensional autonomous systems with polynomial right sides, the lectures of Nussbaum focus on applications of fixed point theorems to the problem of limiting profiles for the solutions of singular perturbations of delay differential equations, and the lectures of Johnson and Mantellini deal with the existence of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits to non-autonomous systems. The volume will be of interest to researchers and graduate students working in these areas. .
