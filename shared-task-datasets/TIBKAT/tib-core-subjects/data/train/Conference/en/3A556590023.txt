Soil Stress-Strain Behavior: Measurement, Modeling and Analysis : A Collection of Papers of the Geotechnical Symposium in Rome, March 16-17, 2006
The material in this work is focused on recent developments in research into the stress-strain behavior of geomaterials, with an emphasis on laboratory measurements, soil constitutive modeling and behavior of soil structures (such as reinforced soils, piles and slopes). The latest advancements in the field, such as the rate effect and dynamic behavior of both clay and sand, behavior of modified soils and soil mixtures, and soil liquefaction are addressed.
