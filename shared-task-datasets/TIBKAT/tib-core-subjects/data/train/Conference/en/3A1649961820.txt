Nanoscale Phenomena : Fundamentals and Applications
The main goal of the present book is to show an intrinsic correlation and mutual influence of three important parts of nanoscience: new phenomena  nanomaterials  nanodevices. For the discovery of new phenomena it is necessary to develop novel nanotechnological processes for the fabrication of nanomaterials. The nanostructures and new phenomena serve as the base for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. According to this concept is organized the book.
