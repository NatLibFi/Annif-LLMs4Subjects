This volume gathers papers presented at the international conference BAIL, which was held at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland from the 14th to the 22nd of June 2018. The conference gathered specialists in the asymptotic and numerical analysis of problems which exhibit layers and interfaces. Covering a wide range of topics and sharing a wealth of insights, the papers in this volume provide an overview of the latest research into the theory and numerical approximation of problems involving boundary and interior layers.
