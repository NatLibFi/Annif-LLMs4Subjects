Ethical and philosophical issues in medical imaging, multimodal learning and fusion across scales for clinical decision support, and topological data analysis for biomedical imaging : 1st International Workshop, EPIMI 2022, 12th International Workshop, ML-CDS 2022, 2nd International Workshop, TDA4BiomedicalImaging, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2022, Singapore, September 18-22, 2022, proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed joint proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Ethical & Philosophical Issues in Medical Imaging (EPIMI 2022); the 12th International Workshop on Multimodal Learning and Fusion Across Scales for Clinical Decision Support (ML-CDS 2022) and the 2nd International Workshop on Topological Data Analysis for Biomedical Imaging (TDA4BiomedicalImaging 2022), held in conjunction with the 25th International Conference on Medical Imaging and Computer-Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2022, in Singapore, in September 2022.EPIMI includes five short papers about various humanistic aspects of medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions. The ML-CDS papers discuss machine learning on multimodal data sets for clinical decision support and treatment planning. The TDA papers focus on Topological Data Analysis: a collection of techniques and tools that have matured from an increasing interest in the role topology plays in machine learning and data science
