Validation of Stochastic Systems : A Guide to Current Research
This tutorial volume presents a coherent and well-balanced introduction to the validation of stochastic systems; it is based on a GI/Dagstuhl research seminar. Supervised by the seminar organizers and volume editors, established researchers in the area as well as graduate students put together a collection of articles competently covering all relevant issues in the area. The lectures are organized in topical sections on: modeling stochastic systems, model checking of stochastic systems, representing large state spaces, deductive verification of stochastic systems
