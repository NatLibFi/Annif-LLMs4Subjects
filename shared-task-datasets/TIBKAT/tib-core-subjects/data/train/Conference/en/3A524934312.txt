Solar Magnetic Phenomena : Proceedings of the 3rd Summerschool and Workshop held at the Solar Observatory Kanzelhöhe, Kärnten, Austria, August 25 - September 5, 2003. Arnold Hanslmeier, Astrid Veronig, Mauro Messerotti
The book contains lecture papers and contributed papers on different aspects of magnetic phenomena in the solar atmosphere. The main topics addressed are the physics of solar flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections, magnetic helicity, high-energy radiation from the Sun, observations of the photosphere and chromosphere as well as highlights from the SOHO mission. The lecture papers provide a very valuable introduction and overview on recent developments in these fields of solar physics. The comprehensive lists of references at the end of each review enable the interested reader to go into more detail. The book is particularly useful for graduate students and young researchers working in solar physics.
