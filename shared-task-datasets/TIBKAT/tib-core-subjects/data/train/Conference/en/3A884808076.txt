Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Frontiers in Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications (FICTA) 2015
The proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Frontiers in Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications 2015 (FICTA 2015) serves as the knowledge centre not only for scientists and researchers in the field of intelligent computing but also for students of post-graduate level in various engineering disciplines. The book covers a comprehensive overview of the theory, methods, applications and tools of Intelligent Computing. Researchers are now working in interdisciplinary areas and the proceedings of FICTA 2015 plays a major role to accumulate those significant works in one arena. The chapters included in the proceedings inculcates both theoretical as well as practical aspects of different areas like Nature Inspired Algorithms, Fuzzy Systems, Data Mining, Signal Processing, Image processing, Text Processing, Wireless Sensor Networks, Network Security and Cellular Automata
