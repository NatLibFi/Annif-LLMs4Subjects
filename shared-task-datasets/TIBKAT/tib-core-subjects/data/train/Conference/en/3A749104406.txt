Speciation of Metals in Water, Sediment and Soil Systems : Proceedings of an International Workshop, Sunne, October 15-16, 1986
The particular behavior of trace metals in the environment is determined by their specific physico-chemical form rather than by their total concentration. The introduction of atomic absorption spectrometry has lead to a plethora of scientific papers and reports in which metal concentrations in the environment are only reported as total concentrations. Only recently has the need for improved knowledge on the various forms and bioavailability of metals been realised. Considerable research effort is now devoted to measuring the concentrations of trace metals in surface waters. Efforts are made to couple chemical analytical techniques to process-related biological problems. The proceedings of the workshop on The Speciation of Metals in Water, Sediment and Soil Systems held in Sunne, Sweden, comprise these efforts and show aspects for further cooperation between analytical chemists and biologists
