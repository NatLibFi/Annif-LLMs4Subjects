Wood & fire safety : proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Wood & Fire Safety 2020
This proceedings volume presents new scientific works of the research workers and experts from the field of Wood Science & Fire. It looks into the properties of various tree species across the continents affecting the fire-technical properties of wood and wood-based materials, its modifications, fire-retardant methods and other technological processes that have an impact on wood ignition and burning. The results of these findings have a direct impact on Building Construction and Design describing the fire safety of wooden buildings, mainly large and multi-story ones. The results of these experiments and findings may be applied, or are directly implemented into Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety which makes the application of wood and wood materials in buildings possible, while maintaining strict fire regulations. One part of the contributions focuses on the symbiosis of the material and the fire-fighting technologies. Wood burning has its own specific features, therefore, the fire protection technologies need to be updated regularly. It also includes the issue of the intervention of fire-fighting and rescue teams in the fires of wooden buildings. Presentations deal with the issue of forest fires influenced by the climate changes, relief, fuel models based on the type and the age of the forest stand. .
1. Structure and properties of wood and its changes at high temperatures -- 2. Wood burning retardation and wood-based materials -- 3. Fire modeling, testing, certification, investigation, dynamic, behaviour modelling, smoke control and combustion toxicity -- 4. Fire safety in wooden objects -- 5. Forest fires -- 6. Other topics focus on wood & fire safety.
