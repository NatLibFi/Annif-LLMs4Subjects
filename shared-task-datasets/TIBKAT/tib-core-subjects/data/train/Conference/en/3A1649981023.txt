Principles and Perspectives in Cosmochemistry : Lecture Notes of the Kodai School on 'Synthesis of Elements in Stars' held at Kodaikanal Observatory, India, April 29 - May 13, 2008
A fundamental question in contemporary astrophysics is the origin of the elements. Cosmochemistry seeks to answer when, how and where the chemical elements arose. Quantitative answers to these fundamental questions require a multi-disciplinary approach involving stellar evolution, explosive nucleosynthesis and nuclear reactions in different astrophysical environments. There remain, however, many outstanding problems and cosmochemistry remains a fertile area of research. This book is among the first in recent times to put together the essentials of cosmochemistry, combining contributions from l
