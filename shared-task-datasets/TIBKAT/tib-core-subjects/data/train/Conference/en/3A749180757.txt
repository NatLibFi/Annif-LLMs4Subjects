Lectures on Concurrency and Petri Nets : Advances in Petri Nets
This tutorial volume originates from the 4th Advanced Course on Petri Nets, ACPN 2003, held in Eichst√§tt, Germany in September 2003. In addition to lectures given at ACPN 2003, additional chapters have been commissioned to give a well-balanced presentation of the state of the art in the area. This book will be useful as both a reference for those working in the area as well as a study book for the reader who is interested in an up-to-date overview of research and development in concurrent and distributed systems; of course, readers specifically interested in theoretical or applicational aspects of Petri nets will appreciate the book as well
