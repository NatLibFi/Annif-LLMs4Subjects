Operator Algebras, Operator Theory and Applications : 18th International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications, Potchefstroom, July 2007
This volume contains the proceedings of the eighteenth International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), hosted by the Unit for Business Mathematics and Informatics of North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa from July 3 to 6, 2007. The conference (as well as these proceedings) was dedicated to Professors Joseph A. Ball and Marinus M. Kaashoek on the occasion of their 60th and 70th birthdays, respectively. This conference had a particular focus on Von Neumann algebras at the interface of operator theory with functional analysis and on applications of operator theory to differential equations.
