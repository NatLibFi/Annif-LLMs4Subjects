Planetary nebulae : an eye to the future; proceedings of the 283rd Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain, July 25-29, 2011
"Planetary nebulae play a key role in stellar evolution as an important fraction of stellar matter in the Universe goes though the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula phases in its lifetime. They are major contributors to the chemical enrichment of galaxies, especially for nitrogen and carbon. They also act as multi-wavelength laboratories for understanding atomic, molecular, dust, and plasma processes in different astrophysical environments, and for studying the dynamics and mass distributions of galaxies. IAU Symposium 283 brought together experts from a variety of countries to present new results including: those from IPHAS and HERSCHEL; the detection of fullerenes in our galaxy and its neighbors; a new catalogue of about 600 planetary nebulae spectra; and the latest three-dimensional models of the common envelope phase. This volume is an essential reference for all those specializing in planetary nebulae research."--Cover p. [4]
