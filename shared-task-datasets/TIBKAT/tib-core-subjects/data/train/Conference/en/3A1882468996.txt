Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XXVII
These are the proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering, which was held in Prague, Czech Republic, in July 2022. Domain decomposition methods are iterative methods for solving the often very large systems of equations that arise when engineering problems are discretized, frequently using finite elements or other modern techniques. These methods are specifically designed to make effective use of massively parallel, high-performance computing systems. The book presents both theoretical and computational advances in this domain, reflecting the state of art in 2022.
