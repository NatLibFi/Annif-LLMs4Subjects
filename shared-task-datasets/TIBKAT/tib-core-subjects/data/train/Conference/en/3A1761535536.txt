Proof and computation II : from proof theory and univalent mathematics to program extraction and verification
"This book is for graduate students and researchers, introducing modern foundational research in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy from an interdisciplinary point of view. Its scope includes proof theory, constructive mathematics and type theory, univalent mathematics and point-free approaches to topology, extraction of certified programs from proofs, automated proofs in the automotive industry, as well as the philosophical and historical background of proof theory. By filling the gap between (under-)graduate level textbooks and advanced research papers, the book gives a scholarly account of recent developments and emerging branches of the aforementioned fields"--
