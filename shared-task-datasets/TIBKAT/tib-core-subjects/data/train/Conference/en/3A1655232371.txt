Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry : Lectures given at the 2nd Session of the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held in Trento, Italy, June 24â€“July 2, 1991
This volume contains three long lecture series by J.L. Colliot-Thelene, Kazuya Kato and P. Vojta. Their topics are respectively the connection between algebraic K-theory and the torsion algebraic cycles on an algebraic variety, a new approach to Iwasawa theory for Hasse-Weil L-function, and the applications of arithemetic geometry to Diophantine approximation. They contain many new results at a very advanced level, but also surveys of the state of the art on the subject with complete, detailed profs and a lot of background. Hence they can be useful to readers with very different background and experience. CONTENTS: J.L. Colliot-Thelene: Cycles algebriques de torsion et K-theorie algebrique.- K.
