Space weather : the physics behind a slogan ; [Spring School on Space Weather - The Physics Behind a Slogan .Ì¤ that took place from March 30 to April 4, 2003]
The various processes that connect the physics of the Sun with that of the Earth`s environment has become known as "Space Weather" during recent years, a slogan that has emerged in connection with many other expressions adapted from meteorology, such as solar wind, magnetic clouds or polar rain. This volume is intended as a first graduate-level textbook-style account on the physics of these solar-terrestrial relations and their impact on our natural and technological environment.
