Time in Physics
Julian Barbour: Arrows of Time in Unconfined Systems -- Maximilan P. E. Lock and Ivette Fuentes: Relativistic quantum clocks -- Nicolas Gisin: Time really passes. Science can't deny that -- Dominik Janzing: Statistical asymmetries between cause and effect -- Thomas Pashby: At what time does a quantum experiment have a result? -- Paolo Perinotti: Causal structures and the classication of order quantum computations -- Tony Short: Re-evaluating space-time -- Vlatko Vedral: Time, (inverse) temperature and cosmological inflation as entanglement -- Ämin Baumeler and Stefan Wolf: Causality - Complexity - Consistency: Can Space-Time Be Based on Logic and Computation?
One of the most important questions concerning the foundations of physics, especially since the discovery of relativity and quantum theory, is the nature and role of time. In this book we bring together researchers from different areas of physics, mathematics, computer science and philosophy to discuss the role time plays in physics. There have been few books on this topic to date, and two of the key aims of the workshop and this book are to encourage more researchers to explore this area, and to pique students’ interest in the different roles time plays in physics
