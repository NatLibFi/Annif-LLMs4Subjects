Numerical Treatment of Multiphase Flows in Porous Media : Proceedings of the International Workshop Held a Beijing, China, 2â€“6 August 1999
This book describes in detail the current, state-of-the-art numerical treatment and simulation of multiphase flows in porous media. The porous media considered range from ordinary to fractured and deformable media, the models treated from single-phase compressible flow to multiphase multicomponent flow with mass interchange, while the computational algorithms encompass everything from classical iterative solvers to modern multigrid and domain decomposition approaches. Addressing many problems originating from the applied geosciences, the book focuses on their common mathematical and computational aspects. It will serve as an excellent research reference for all geoscientists, mathematicians, physicists, and engineers who work in the mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flows in porous media
