Advances in Communications and Signal Processing
This international conference on "Advances in Communications and Control Systems" was held to bring together researchers in communications, control systems, computing and signal processing to explore common themes and present research results of broad interest. The focus of the conference was on presenting research results in a fashion that would make them accessible to groups wider than that of the narrow specialist. Many papers, therefore, are of a type that might be termed survey/research. The topics include control theory, communication detection, high speed computing, distributed parameter systems, nonlinear systems, stochastic optimization, source coding, robust control and applications, and neural networks. Selected papers from the conference are presented both in this book and in its companion volume Advances in Computing and Control
