Inverse Problems in Medical Imaging and Nondestructive Testing : Proceedings of the Conference in Oberwolfach, Federal Republic of Germany, February 4â€“10, 1996
14 contributions present mathematical models for different imaging techniques in medicine and nondestructive testing. The underlying mathematical models are presented in a way that also newcomers in the field have a chance to understand the relation between the special applications and the mathematics needed for successfully treating these problems. The reader gets an insight into a modern field of scientific computing with applications formerly not presented in such form, leading from the basics to actual research activities
