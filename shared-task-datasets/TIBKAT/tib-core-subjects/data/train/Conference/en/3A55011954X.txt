Drying of porous materials : [selected papers presented at the XI Polish Drying Symposium, held in Pozna≈Ñ ... on September 13 - 16, 2005]
This book provides recent advances in research on drying of particulate and porous materials. It is based on a selection of papers presented at the XI the Polish Drying Symposium 2005. The selected contributions cover theoretical, as well as experimental and modeling research on heat and mass transfer processes during drying of porous material, and fluidized beds. The comprehensiveness and in depth treatment of the subject makes this book an excellent pioneering contribution to the science and technology of drying of particulate solids.
