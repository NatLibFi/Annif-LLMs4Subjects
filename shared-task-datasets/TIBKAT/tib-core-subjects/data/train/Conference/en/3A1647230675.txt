Inverse Problems and Imaging : Lectures given at the C.I.M.E. Summer School held in Martina Franca, Italy September 15–21, 2002
Nowadays we are facing numerous and important imaging problems: nondestructive testing of materials, monitoring of industrial processes, enhancement of oil production by efficient reservoir characterization, emerging developments in noninvasive imaging techniques for medical purposes - computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), X-ray and ultrasound tomography, etc. In the CIME Summer School on Imaging (Martina Franca, Italy 2002), leading experts in mathematical techniques and applications presented broad and useful introductions for non-experts and practitioners alike to many aspects of this exciting field. The volume contains part of the above lectures completed and updated by additional contributions on other related topics: a general presentation and introduction (Moscoso), X-ray tomography (Natterer), Electromagnetic imaging (Dorn, Bertete-Aguirre, Papanicolaou), coherent imaging in telecommunications in a multiple input-multiple output setup (Dorn), polarization based optical imaging (Moscoso), topological derivatives used in shape reconstruction related to inverse scattering problems (Carpio, Rapún), Point interactions (Dell’Antonio, Figari, Teta).
to Image Reconstruction -- X-ray Tomography -- Adjoint Fields and Sensitivities for 3D Electromagnetic Imaging in Isotropic and Anisotropic Media -- Polarization-Based Optical Imaging -- Topological Derivatives for Shape Reconstruction -- Time-Reversal and the Adjoint Imaging Method with an Application in Telecommunication -- A Brief Review on Point Interactions.
