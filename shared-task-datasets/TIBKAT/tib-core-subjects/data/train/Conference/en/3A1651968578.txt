This volume is a selection of contributions offered by friends, collaborators, past students in memory of Enrico Magenes. The first part gives a wide historical perspective of Magenes' work in his 50-year mathematical career; the second part contains original research papers, and shows how ideas, methods, and techniques introduced by Magenes and his collaborators still have an impact on the current research in Mathematics.
