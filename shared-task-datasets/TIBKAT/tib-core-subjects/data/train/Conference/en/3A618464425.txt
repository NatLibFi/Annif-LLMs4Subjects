Characteristic Functions, Scattering Functions and Transfer Functions : The Moshe Livsic Memorial Volume ; [During the period July 9 to July 13, 2007, a conference called "Characteristic functions and transfer functions in operator theory and system theory: a conference dedicated to Paul Fuhrmann on his 70th anniversary and to the memory of Moshe Livsic on his 90th anniversary" was held at the Department of Mathematics of BenGurion University of the Negev]
The notions of transfer function and characteristic functions proved to be fundamental in the last fifty years in operator theory and in system theory. Moshe Livsic played a central role in developing these notions, and the book contains a selection of carefully chosen refereed papers dedicated to his memory. Topics include classical operator theory, ergodic theory and stochastic processes, geometry of smooth mappings, mathematical physics, Schur analysis and system theory. The variety of topics attests well to the breadth of Moshe Livsic's mathematical vision and the deep impact of his work
