Adaptive Control Strategies for Industrial Use : Proceedings of a Workshop Kananaskis, Canada, 1988
The objective of this workshop was to bring together engineers from industry and scientists from universities to focus attention on new developments and practical enhancements for using adaptive control in industry. The workshop provided a forum for a tutorial introduction to the state-of-the-art in adaptive control and helped focus attention on an in-depth view of the problems and needs of adaptive control engineers in industry. The volume includes papers concerned with recent theoretical advances in adaptive control, experimental application of adaptive control in industry and the role of filters in adaptive control
