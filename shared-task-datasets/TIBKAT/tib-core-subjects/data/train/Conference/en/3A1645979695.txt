Multiple Stars Across the H-R Diagram : Proceedings of the ESO Workshop held in Garching, Germany, 12-15 July 2005
The ESO workshop &quot;Multiple Stars across the H-R Diagram&quot; was held in Garching on July 12-15, 2005. The topics included observations of multiple stars from ground and space, dynamical and stellar evolution in multiple systems, effects of the environment on multiplicity, formation and early evolution of multiple stars, and special components of multiple stars. Research on multiple stars has seen major developments during recent years due to the availability of large-aperture telescopes equipped with highly sophisticated instruments for multi-wavelength observations, of modern interfero
This volume presents results from the ESO workshop Multiple Stars across the H-R Diagram, held in Garching in July 2005. It covers observations of multiple stars from ground and space, dynamical and stellar evolution in multiple systems, formation and early evolution of multiple stars, and special components of multiple stars. The book reviews the current state of observational and theoretical knowledge and discusses future studies for further progress in the field.
