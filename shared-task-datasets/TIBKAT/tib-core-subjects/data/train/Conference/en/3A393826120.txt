Polar oxides : properties, characterization, and imaging ; [the publication of this book follows a Workshop on "Polar Oxides - Properties, Characterizing and Imaging" which was held in Capri, Italy, in June 2003]
The book encompasses a wide range of topics including the characterization and investigation of structural, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of ceramic materials such as transition metal oxides (including PZT, PLZT, BTO, BST etc). Further issues are phase transitions, electrical and optical properties as well as microscopic investigations. A number of renowned international experts discuss and assess the properties of these materials under the aspects of new and advanced characterization and imaging techniques
