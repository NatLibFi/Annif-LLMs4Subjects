Mechanics and Control : Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Control Mechanics, January 21-23, 1991 University of Southern California, USA
The workshop on Control Mechanics, originated in 1988, beca- me an annual event and gained considerable recognition in advancing control of nonlinear and uncertain mechanical sy- tems and promoting application of advanced mechanics in con- trol. The fourth meeting continues the tradition with 17 papers containing original and recent work of the partici- pants developed in 3 basic directions: feed-back control of uncertain systems, flexible mechanical structures and flight control
