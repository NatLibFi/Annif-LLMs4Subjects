This volume gives a state of the art of triangular norms which can be used for the generalization of several mathematical concepts, such as conjunction, metric, measure, etc. 16 chapters written by leading experts provide a state of the art overview of theory and applications of triangular norms and related operators in fuzzy logic, measure theory, probability theory, and probabilistic metric spaces. Key Features: - Complete state of the art of the importance of triangular norms in various mathematical fields - 16 self-contained chapters with extensive bibliographies cover both the theoretical background and many applications - Chapter authors are leading authorities in their fields - Triangular norms on different domains (including discrete, partially ordered) are described - Not only triangular norms but also related operators (aggregation operators, copulas) are covered - Book contains many enlightening illustrations Complete state of the art of the importance of triangular norms in various mathematical fields 16 self-contained chapters with extensive bibliographies cover both the theoretical background and many applications Chapter authors are leading authorities in their fields Triangular norms on different domains (including discrete, partially ordered) are described Not only triangular norms but also related operators (aggregation operators, copulas) are covered Book contains many enlightening illustrations
