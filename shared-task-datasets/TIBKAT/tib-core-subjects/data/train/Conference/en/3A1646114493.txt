This Festschrift contains a collection of articles by friends, co-authors, colleagues, and former Ph.D. students of Keith Glover, Professor of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday. Professor Glover's scientific work spans a wide variety of topics, the main themes being system identification, model reduction and approximation, robust controller synthesis, and control of aircraft and engines. The articles in this volume are a tribute to Professor Glover's seminal work in these areas.
