"How can we address the rising social and spatial inequality produced by an ever-growing planetary urbanization? ... This publication brings together three approaches to this crucial issue."--Back cover
"The six speculative proposals presented in this catalogue are the result of a productive and dynamic fourteen-month initiative spanning multiple continents and bringing together architects of local knowledge and international experience ... The MAK-Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art and its Director, Christoph Thun-Hohenstein ... have been both generous hosts--organizing the project's final workshop and providing a second venue for the exhibition at its 2015 Vienna Biennale"--Page 7
