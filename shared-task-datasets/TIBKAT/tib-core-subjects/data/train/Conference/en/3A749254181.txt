Category Theory and Computer Science : 7th International Conference, CTCS '97 Santa Margherita Ligure Italy, September 4-6, 1997 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Category Theory and Computer Science, CTCS'97, held in Santa Margheria Ligure, Italy, in September 1997. Category theory attracts interest in the theoretical computer science community because of its ability to establish connections between different areas in computer science and mathematics and to provide a few generic principles for organizing mathematical theories. This book presents a selection of 15 revised full papers together with three invited contributions. The topics addressed include reasoning principles for types, rewriting, program semantics, and structuring of logical systems
