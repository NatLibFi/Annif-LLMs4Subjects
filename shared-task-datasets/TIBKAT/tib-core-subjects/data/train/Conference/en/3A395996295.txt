Functional analytic methods for evolution equations
This book consists of five introductory contributions by leading mathematicians on the functional analytic treatment of evolutions equations. In particular the contributions deal with Markov semigroups, maximal L^p-regularity, optimal control problems for boundary and point control systems, parabolic moving boundary problems and parabolic nonautonomous evolution equations. The book is addressed to PhD students, young researchers and mathematicians doing research in one of the above topics. TOC:Preface.- Giuseppe Da Prato: An Introduction to Markov Semigroups.- Peer C.
