Eukaryotic microalgae have been extensively studied for several decades for their suitability as drug producers, with only a few potentially useful compounds identified. Nevertheless, the huge biodiversity alone suggests that there must be producers of interesting secondary metabolites. In recent years, it has also been shown that microalgae can be suppliers of valuable substances, for example in the field of renewable energies. Here, above all, the high cultivation costs and the low product yield are still obstacles to be overcome. In this work, 70 eukaryotic microalgae strains were tested for their suitability as producers of novel active and valuable substances. In addition, it was determined by varying the culturing conditions whether the cultivation costs can be lowered and the yields of relevant products from microalgae can be increased. The investigated microalgae were obtained from the strain collection of Pharmaceutical Biology of the University of Greifswald, from commercial strain collections or were isolated from water samples collected near Greifswald. New isolates were identified by molecular genetic methods. All microalgae were first cultured under standard conditions, and the biomass space-time yield was determined and evaluated. Subsequently, the biochemical composition of the biomass was analyzed. For this purpose, six methods for total lipid, total carbohydrate and total protein content determination as well as for the analysis of lipid and carbohydrate ...
