In recent years, biopolymers like polyhydroxyalcanoates (PHA) became more an more interesting for the substitution of plastics. Nowadays three types of biopolymers are most attractive, namely poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), poly-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHV) and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV). For cost-effective manufacturing of PHA biotechnically established producers are necessary. For an environmentally friendly production yeasts provide this feature most suitable. Nevertheless yeasts do not carry the necessary genetic pool for PHA synthesis. The successfully achieved aims of the present study were to realize the integration of genes, which synthesize PHB or PHBV respectively, into the yeast genome of Arxula adeninivorans. Therefore Yeast Integration Expression Cassettes (YIEC) had been designed to integrate the PHA genes into the 25S-rDNA of A. adeninivorans. These YIEC consist of different gene cassettes which solely or in combination generate the functional PHB or PHBV genes depending on the biochemical background of the yeast strain. This study used gene cassettes which had been taken from bacteria strains such as Cupriavidus necator and Methylobacterium extorquens ...
