Assembly and repeat annotation of the nothobranchius furzeri genome
In aging research, the long lifespan of the current vertebrate model organisms challenges the feasibility of research efforts. The turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri has the shortest lifespan for vertebrates known so far (4-12 months) making it to a valuable new model in aging research. In this thesis, the multi-step process of building genome reference sequence of N. furzeri is described. Based on a broad range of sequencing data and additional map resources, a high-quality genome assembly with a size of 1.24 Gb (N50 57.4 Mb, 19 chromosomes) was achieved. Furthermore, the composition of repetitive sequences in the N. furzeri genome was analyzed. In addition to established repeat detection methods a new software solution (RepARK) was developed and applied. In this analysis, 35.5% of the genome assembly was annotated as repetitive. Using this repeat annotation, it was estimated that the genome assembly contains 90% of the unique sequence while about 60% of the repeats are absent. An analysis in not-assembled data suggests a repeat content in the N. furzeri genome ranging from 56% to 70%. This missing fraction needs to be resolved by further third generation sequencing efforts to study the role of repeats in biological processes such as aging.
