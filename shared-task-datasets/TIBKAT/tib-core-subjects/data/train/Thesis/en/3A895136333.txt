Development of a new microscopy method : optical photon reassignment microscopy
In this thesis a promising new superresolution technique called Optical Photon Reassignment (OPRA) microscopy is introduced and applied to the field of fluorescence microscopy. The method is a optical realization of the computer-based reassignment principle in confocal microscopy introduced by Sheppard in 1988 [17]. There, the spatial information in the pinhole plane is used to increase the resolution. In the year 2010 this method received a lot attention as MÃ¼ller and Enderlein published the same principle including experimental data from fluorescent samples [23]. As in OPRA the computational reassignment process is done optically, any necessary processing is avoided and only one camera readout is required. The microscopy concept, together with proof-of-principle experiments and a mathematical framework, was published and patented in 2013 [24, SR1]. The method combines several important properties of fluorescent imaging towards non invasive live-cell imaging in a unique way. OPRA achieves two-fold resolution enhancement in the focal plane if compared with the cut-off frequency of standard widefield microscopy. As OPRA does not require any processing, it is suitable for extremely fast imaging, especially if the method is parallelized. ...
