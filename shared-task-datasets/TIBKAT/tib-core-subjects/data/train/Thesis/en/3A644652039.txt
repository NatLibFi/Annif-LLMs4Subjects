Exciting imperfection : real-structure effects in magnesium-, cadmium-, and zinc-oxide
Computational condensed-matter physics, as a branch of modern solid-state physics, comprises the field of ab-initio calculations. Nowadays, challenging parameter-free studies can be carried out that deal with the many-body aspects due to the involved electron-electron interaction. Theoretical-spectroscopy techniques provide insight into electronic excitations, paving the way towards computer-aided materials design, e.g., for photovoltaics. In this thesis the transparent conductive oxides MgO, ZnO, and CdO are investigated; they are important materials for transparent-oxide electronics. Initially, a hybrid functional is used to model exchange and correlation. Subsequently, quasiparticle energies are calculated using Hedin's GW approximation of the electronic self energy. This leads to band structures, densities of states, spin-orbit splittings, effective band masses, and natural band discontinuities. Solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the optical polarization function yields the complex dielectric function including excitonic and local-field effects. All underlying atomic geometries result from density-functional theory based on local or semi-local approximations to exchange and correlation.
