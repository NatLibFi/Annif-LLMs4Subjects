Approximate antenna analysis for CAD
"In this book, Hubregt J. Visser provides an introduction to the fundamentals of antenna design and the implementation of design models. A variety of antennas for wireless applications and communications systems are explained, and the real-life use of antennas is demonstrated through extensive use of application examples. The author includes discussions on the design process of several antennas, such as intravascular MR antennas, PCB antennas, RFID antennas, rectennas, etc. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on Computer Aided Design (CAD) using approximated models."--Publisher description
