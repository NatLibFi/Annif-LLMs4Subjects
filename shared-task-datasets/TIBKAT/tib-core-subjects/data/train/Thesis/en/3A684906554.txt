The excited state intramolecular hydrogen transfer mechanism of ortho-Nitrobenzaldehyde : a quantum chemical and molecular dynamics study
This thesis is a theoretical analysis of the photorelaxation mechanism of ortho-Nitrobenzaldehyde o-NBA. O-NBA is a photolabile protecting group, in which an excited state intramolecular H-transfer takes place. Recent experiments suggest that this photoreaction might proceed via ketene intermediate. Yet, little is known about the mechanism of this photoreaction. For this, first highly accurate multi-state complete active space second order perturbation over complete active space self-consistent field MSCASPT2/CASSCF calculations of o-NBA UV-spectrum in gas phase have been performed. The excited state S5 has been assigned as the spectroscopic state from where the experimental wavelength at 260 nm initiates the H-transfer photoreaction. The effects of different positional isomers and of solutesolvent interactions are also addressed along this thesis, without significant changes, merely blue-shift with solvatation. ...
