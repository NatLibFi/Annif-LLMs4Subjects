Optimization and application of a flexible dual arm robot based automation system for sample preparation and measurement
This dissertation describes the optimization of the implementation of the Yaskawa SDA10F dual-arm robot to carry out routine sample preparation tasks in a life science laboratory such that standard lab equipment can be used and the robot can replace humans in sample preparation process. The existing robot control software is changed to carry out various tasks consecutively without interruption. Robot environment and motions were optimized allowing system expansion, multiple batches of samples are made at a time, increasing throughput. The system was validated with the help of two applications.<eng>
