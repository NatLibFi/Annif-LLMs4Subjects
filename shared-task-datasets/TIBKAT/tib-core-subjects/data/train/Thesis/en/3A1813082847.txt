Protective and adjuvant environments in the context of allergic diseases : a study on the role of small organic compounds
Studies demonstrated a low prevalence of allergy and asthma among farmer children compared to non-farmer children. We targeted small respirable compounds in the gas and particulate phase of distinct farming aerosols to gain first insights of a potential allergy-protective effect of such small organic compounds. Specific differences between a potential protective (cow shed) and non-protective (sheep shed) environment were identified and biologically tested. Moreover, allergy-adjuvant environments derived from distinct diesel exhaust and pollen exposure were comprehensively characterized.<eng>
