Predicting evapotranspiration from drone-recorded land surface temperatures : method testing and development
Evapotranspiration (ET) is a central flux in the hydrological cycle on a regional and on a global scale. Transpiration from plants is the largest water flux from terrestrial surfaces, accounting for the major part of terrestrial ET. This thesis comprises method comparisons of methods for ET and plant-water-use analyses. Established and well-tested methods are compared with recently emerging methods based on drone remote sensing thermography and modelling approaches. The presented studies were developed and realized in the frame work of the Collaborative Research Centre 990 and the subprojec...
