Fiktionales versus faktuales Erz√§hlen fremden Bewusstseins
"The depiction of another person's consciousness is often regarded as the key characteristic of fictional narrative. Is it true, though, that factual narrative avoids presenting alien consciousness? This question is the focus of the present study. Using a computer-assisted diachronic narratological approach, the author analyzes a corpus of five coming-of-age novels and five biographies from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries."--
