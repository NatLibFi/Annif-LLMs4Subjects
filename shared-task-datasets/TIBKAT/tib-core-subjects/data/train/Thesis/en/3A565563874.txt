Relations between seismic signals and reservoir properties of deep gas reservoirs in Northwest-Germany - Wustrow member, Rotliegend
This study tries to find the petrophysical basis for correlations between reservoir properties and seismic signals calibrated with geological information for Wustrow-sediments of the Rotliegend in NW-Germany. A secondary objective consists in explaining the large scatter of permeability for Wustrow reservoir rocks of comparable properties. The correlations were ascertained in the DGMK-project 593-8, for instance to authigenic clay mineral types and permeability. The investigations demonstrate that the differences in seismic signals (amplitude, shape and lateral coherency of seismic traces) are a product of distinct compressional field velocities (from wireline logs) and attenuation processes as in-situ bulk densities are barely varying within the investigated horizon. The regions of different clay mineral authigenesis (illite and chlorite) diverge by their average compressional in-situ speeds. The differences suffice to provoke relevant variations in seismic signals. Total porosity appears not to affect the field wave characteristics distinctly as high void volumes are encountered in the province of high compressional speed. The distinct velocities for rocks of different authigenesis and the subsidiary effect of void volume are ascertained also at plug dimensions. Other rock properties affecting wave characteristics than porosity become thus relevant. Plugs of comparable properties but largely varying compressional ultrasonic velocity are analyzed for textural features which certainly or potentially influence wave characteristics. These features represent, affect or indicate also reservoir quality ...
