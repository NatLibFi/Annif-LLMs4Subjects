Understanding Himalayan denudation at the catchment and orogen scale
Understanding the rates and processes of denudation is key to unraveling the dynamic processes that shape active orogens. This includes decoding the roles of tectonic and climate-driven processes in the long-term evolution of high- mountain landscapes in regions with pronounced tectonic activity and steep climatic and surface-process gradients. Well-constrained denudation rates can be used to address a wide range of geologic problems. In steady-state landscapes, denudation rates are argued to be proportional to tectonic or isostatic uplift rates and provide valuable insight into the tectonic regimes underlying surface denudation. The use of denudation rates based on terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) such as 10Beryllium has become a widely-used method to quantify catchment-mean denudation rates. Because such measurements are averaged over timescales of 102 to 105 years, they are not as susceptible to stochastic changes as shorter-term denudation rate estimates (e.g., from suspended sediment measurements) and are therefore consideredâ€¦
