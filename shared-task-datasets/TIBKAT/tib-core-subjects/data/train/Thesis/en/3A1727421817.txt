Integral geometry on the octonionic plane
A basis of the space of Spin(9)-invariant translation-invariant continuous valuations on the octonionic plane is presented in terms of invariant differential forms. Furthermore, the canonical algebra structure on this space is determined in terms of generators andexplicit relations. As a result, the Principal kinematic formula on the octonionic plane is computed by means of our basis. A bi-product of the notion of octonion-valued forms, upon which our construction heavily depends, is a new simple algebraic formula for the canonical Spin(9)-invariant 8-form. Finally, motivated by our results, we conjecture a version of the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations for smooth translation-invariant valuations.
