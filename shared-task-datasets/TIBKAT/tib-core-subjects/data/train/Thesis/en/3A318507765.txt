Die verschiedenen Formen und Funktionen des zentralen Grenzwertsatzes in der Entwicklung von der klassischen zur modernen Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung
This study discusses the historical development of the probabilistic central limit theorem from about 1810 through 1940. The central limit theorem was originally deduced by Laplace as a statement about approximations for sums of independent random variables in the framework of classical probability which focused upon specific problems and applications. Making this theorem an autonomous mathematical object was very important for the development of modern probability theory. The mathematical perspectives and the analytic methods connected with the central limit theorem, and its applications to mathematical statistics are discussed in this book thoroughly from a historical point of view.
