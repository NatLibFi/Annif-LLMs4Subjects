The classification of isotrivially fibred surfaces with p g
In our thesis we treat mainly two topics: the classification of isotrivially fibred surfaces with p_g=q=2, and the construction of new Beauville surfaces. An isotrivially fibred surface is a smooth projective surface endowed with a morphism onto a smooth curve such that all the smooth fibres are isomorphic to each other. The first goal of this thesis is to classify the isotrivially fibred surfaces with p_g=q=2 completing and extending a result by Zucconi. As an important byproduct, we provide new examples of minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=q=2 and K^2=4,5 and the first example with K^2=6. We say that a surface S is isogenous to a product of curves if S = (C times F )/G, for C and F smooth curves and G a finite group acting freely on C times F. Beauville surfaces are a special case of surfaces isogenous to a product. In this thesis we include part of a joint work with Shelly Garion, in which we construct new Beauville surfaces with group G either PSL(2,p^e), or A_n, or S_n, proving a conjecture of Bauer, Catanese and Grunewald. The proofs rely on probabilistic group theoretical results of Liebeck and Shalev, and on classical results of Macbeath ...
