Modelling and optimization of photovoltaic cells, modules, and systems
This book presents a study to determine the current limitations in the area of Photovoltaics (PV) as a source of renewable energy and proposes strategies to overcome them by applying optimization approaches in three main areas, namely related to photovoltaic solar cells, modules, and systems. These include grid metallization design of Si-based solar cells and modules; cost-effectiveness analysis between Si-based monofacial and bifacial grid-connected PV systems; optimal diesel replacement strategy for the progressive introduction of PV and batteries; dispatch strategy optimization for PV hybrid systems in real time. The novelty of the work presented in this book is of high interest to the scientific community but also to the PV manufacturers, installation companies, and investors.
