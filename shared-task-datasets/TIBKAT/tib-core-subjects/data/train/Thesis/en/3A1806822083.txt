Materials design and engineering for high energy-density rechargeable zinc-air batteries
The growing demands for energy and the associated environmental pollution have sparked a great deal of interest in the development of clean energy technologies including fuel cells, metal-air batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen production. Among them, Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are potential possibilities because of their low cost, high theoretical energy density, high-level safety, and environmental friendliness. In addition, zinc (Zn) is abundant in the environment and far less expensive than lithium metals. Thus, ZABs have been proposed as promising energy sources for grid-scale ener...
