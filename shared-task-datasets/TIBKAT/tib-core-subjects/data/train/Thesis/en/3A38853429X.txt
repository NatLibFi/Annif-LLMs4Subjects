Especially on interannual to multidecadal time scales, where the amount of bservations is limited, many open questions remain. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the reaction of a numerical model of the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean to changes in the atmospheric surface forcing and to improve the understanding of the internal variability of the model and furthermore the real ocean-sea ice system. The ocean model is based on the MOM-2 code, which is coupled to a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model with a viscous-plastic rheology. A major mode of atmospheric variability over the North Atlantic Ocean is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Two 200 year integrations of the coupled ocean-sea ice model with surface boundary conditions which are related to periods of positive and negative NAO are compared to an integration with climatological atmospheric forcing over thesame number of years. The experiment with climatological forcing ...
