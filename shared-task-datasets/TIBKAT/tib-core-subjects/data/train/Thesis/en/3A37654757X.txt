The innermost kernel : depth psychology and quantum physics ; Wolfgang Pauli's dialogue with C. G. Jung
The work is divided into three main sections. The first presents the general historical, intellectual and philosophical background of the dialogue between Pauli and Jung. This first section sets the stage, reviewing the general cultural and intellectual climate of Europe between the turn of the century and the period between the world wars. The intent of this section is to place the epistemological crisis, which inundated physics during the emergence of quantum mechanics, as well as the dramatis personae of this process, into the context of the history of ideas. The second section takes a closer look at the connection between physics and depth psychology, by focusing on two representatives of the Copenhagen school and presenting their views on this matter: Pascual Jordan and Niels Bohr. A comparison of Bohr's and Jung's epistemological standpoints is also undertaken. The thrid section discusses the specific philosophical bases of Pauli's interest in the psychology of C.G. Jung and explores some of the main issues discussed in their correspondence as for instance the relation of conscious and unconscious, the theory of archetypes, the process underlying concept-formation, the psychology of scientific discovery and the theory of synchronicity
