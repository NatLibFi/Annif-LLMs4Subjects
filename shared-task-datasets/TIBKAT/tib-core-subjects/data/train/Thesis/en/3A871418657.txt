Charge multiplication detectors for use in the HL-LHC and measurement of the production cross-section in pp collisions of a W boson in association with a charm quark at sqrt (s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector
Zusammenfassung: The exploration into the subatomic world has lead to particle accelerators of every increasing size. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), currently the world’s largest particle accelerator and machine, was built with the primary goal of dis- covering the Higgs boson, the last ingredient of the Standard Model, and to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model’s predictions. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations has been a triumph for human ingenuity. Although its discovery is an important milestone in understanding the fundamental workings of nature, the search for a full uni- fied theory describing all natural phenomena is far from over. Physicists know the Standard Model is not the end game, as it fails to account for various ob- served phenomena, which include dark matter, dark energy, and perhaps most embarrassingly, gravity. The search for new physics requires precise knowledge of several parameters in the Standard Model. This includes the distribution of quarks and gluons inside the proton, usually in terms of parton distribution functions, or PDFs. T
