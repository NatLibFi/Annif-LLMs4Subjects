Past and present biodiversity in northeastern Siberia inferred from sedimentary DNA metabarcoding
The arctic-boreal treeline is a transition zone from taiga to tundra covering a vast area in Siberia. It often features large environmental gradients and reacts sensitively to changes in the environment. For example, the expansion of shrubs and a northward movement of the treeline are observable in Siberia as a response to the warming climate. The changes in vegetation across the treeline are known to influence the water chemistry in the lakes. This causes further alteration to the composition and diversity of sensitive aquatic organisms such as diatoms and macrophytes. Despite the rising awareness of the complex climate-feedback mechanisms of terrestrial plants, the understanding of their assembly rules and about responses of aquatic biomes in the surrounding treeline lakes is still limited. The goal of this thesis is to examine the previous and present biodiversity of terrestrial and freshwater biomes from the Siberian treeline ecotone, as well as their reactions to environmental changes. In particular, this thesis attempts to ...
