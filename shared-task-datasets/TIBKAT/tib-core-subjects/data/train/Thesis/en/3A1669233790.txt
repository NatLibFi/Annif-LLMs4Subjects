Comparison of stochastic processes by Markov projection and functional Itô calculus
Abstract: In this thesis a systematic approach to the comparison of stochastic processes is pursued. In particular the classes of Markov processes and semimartingales are considered. Comparison results for the one-dimensional marginals of Markov processes are established and then transferred to semimartingales by the method of Markov projections. Also a direct comparison of one-dimensional marginals of general semimartingales is accomplished. This then is generalized to more-dimensional marginals by functional Itô calculus
