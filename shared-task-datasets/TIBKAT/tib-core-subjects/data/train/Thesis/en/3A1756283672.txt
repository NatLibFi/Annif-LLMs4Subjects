Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and GPI-anchored proteins tethered to lipid bilayers : modelling a complex interplay of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are highly complex glycolipids that serve as membrane anchors to a large variety of eukaryotic proteins. These are covalently attached to a group of peripheral proteins called GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) through a post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum. The GPI anchor is a unique structure composed of a glycan, with phospholipid tail at one end and a phosphoethanolamine linker at the other where the protein attaches. The glycan part of the GPI comprises a conserved pseudopentasaccharide core that could branch out to carry additional glycosyl or phosphoethanolamine units. GPI-APs are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes, few of which are signal transduction, protein trafficking, pathogenesis by protozoan parasites like the malaria- causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. GPIs can also exist freely on the membrane surface without an attached protein such as those found in parasites like Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of Toxoplasmosis. [...]
