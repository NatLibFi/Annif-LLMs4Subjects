Nutrient stocks, acidity of N transformation and net uptake of methane in soils of a temperate deciduous forest with different abundance of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)
Tree species can influence soil properties, processes and related soil functions. Whilst differences between conifers and deciduous tree species in affecting soils properties and functions have frequently been reported, the influence of different deciduous tree species in mixed stands on soil processes and ecosystem biogeochemistry is rarely understood. Therefore, a temperate deciduous forest with differing beech abundance and tree species diversity was investigated regarding acidity, nutrient stocks and organic matter content as well as nitrogen (N) transformations in the soil and the soil sink strength for atmospheric methane (CH4). The aim was to analyze the key factors that determine the spatial variability of these soil properties and processes in a deciduous mixed forest and to elucidate the influence of beech abundance on soil properties and functions. For that purpose, stands were selected in the Hainich National Park in Central Germany with i) European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) ...
