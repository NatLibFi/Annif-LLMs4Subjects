Bio-based building blocks from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione as intermediate
This dissertation reports on the synthesis and applications of the biomass-derived 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD). A new catalytic process was developed for the hydrogenation/hydrolytic ring opening of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) resulting in the formation of HHD in good yields. Furthermore, HHD was converted to useful follow-up products including pyrroles and cyclopentanone derivatives. Additionally, readily accessible rhenium(VII) oxide was used for the catalytic deoxydehydration of renewable triols under solvent-free and aerobic conditions resulting in formation of the hydroxy-alkenes.<eng>
