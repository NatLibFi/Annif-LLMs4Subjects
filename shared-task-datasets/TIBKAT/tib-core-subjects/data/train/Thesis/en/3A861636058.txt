Interplay between mineral reaction and deformation via structural defects
This thesis contains three experimental studies addressing the interplay between deformation and the mineral reaction between natural calcite and magnesite. The solid-solid mineral reaction between the two carbonates causes the formation of a magnesio-calcite precursor layer and a dolomite reaction rim in every experiment at isostatic annealing and deformation conditions. CHAPTER 1 briefly introduces general aspects concerning mineral reactions in nature and diffusion pathways for mass transport. Moreover, results of previous laboratory studies on the influence of deformation on mineral reactions are summarized. In addition, the main goals of this study are pointed out. In CHAPTER 2, the reaction between calcite and magnesite single crystals is examined at isostatic annealing conditions. Time series performed at a fixed temperature revealed a diffusion-controlled dolomite rim growth. Two microstructural domains could be identified characterized by palisade-shaped dolomite grains growing into the magnesite and granular dolomite gâ€¦
