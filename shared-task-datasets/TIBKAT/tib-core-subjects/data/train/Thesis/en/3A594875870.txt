Model based construction of embedded & real-time software
While model-based software engineering - due to its increased abstraction and its advantages in terms of traceability and analyzability - seems to be the adequate means to deal with the increased complexity of software that one faces today, it does not seem to have penetrated all domains yet, in particular not the one of small embedded & real-time systems. Seeing this problem caused by the fact that current model-based approaches do not pay sufficient attention to the rather special technical, organizational, and economical constraints in the respective domain, this work presents an approach that explicitly takes these constraints into account. MeDUSA, a model-based software construction method for small embedded & real-time systems, is a principal item of the presented solution. To face the strong technical constraints it was especially designed as an instance-driven method, not incorporating any object-oriented concepts, but forcing a class-based design that can be seamlessly transferred into a procedural implementation, which is still state-of- the-art in the regarded domain. To guarantee such a seamless transition MeDUSA was furthermore designed to be a software construction rather than a mere design method, explicitly also addressing the implementation activities ...
