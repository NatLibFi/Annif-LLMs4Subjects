Novel Ru-photosensitizer as versatile building blocks for (molecular) architectures
Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes are interesting for a wide range of applications. The incorporation of ruthenium complexes as modular units in larger hierarchical architectures represents a promising approach for improvements of well-known materials as shown by the formation of metallopolymeric films for catalysis and the synthesis of redox active polymeric donor-photosensitizer-acceptor triads for the conversion of light into chemical bond energy. The construction of such large well-defined architectures by convential synthetic pathways results in a large synthetic effort so that a new efficient strategy had to be developed. The stepwise assembly, where the redox active units can be used like a construction kit provides a facile access to a modular use in which single parts can be exchanged without the repetition of the complete synthesis. Hence, capable synthetic pathways for the single units as well as the coupling step are required. The chemistry-on-the-complex methodology offers an alternative pathway to classical procedures and, thus, guarantees a modular assembly. In this thesis, an efficient synthetic strategy for the assembly of polymeric D-P-A systems was presented. Therefore, the usage of the [Ru(dqp)2]2+ photosensitizer was incorporated into a D-P-A triad. In this regard the application of the complex in the architectures required the preservation of the photophysical and electrochemical behavior of the complex, which can be influenced by the functionalization. Spectroscopic measurements were investigated to confirm this preservation.
