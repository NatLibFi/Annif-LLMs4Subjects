Generalized inverses of differential-algebraic equations and their discretization
In this dissertation we present numerical methods for the computation of generalized solutions of over- or underdetermined differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). After an introdution in the theory of linear DAEs and the associated generalized solutions we present the following main results: - In section 3.2 we show that the local (step-wise) minimization of a BDF discretization of a linear DAE leads to an O(h) approximation of a certain generalized solution of the DAE. - In section 3.3 it is shown that the global minimization of a linear DAE, i.e., the least-squares solution of the discretization, leads to an O(h) approximation of the least-squares solution of the DAE. Implementations of the methods presented here are given on the enclosed CD-ROM. In section 4 of this dissertation the above results are verified by numerical tests.
