Methoden zur Klimarekonstruktion aus historischen Quellen am Beispiel Mitteleuropas
The ubiquity and quality of text-based historical sources in Central Europe enables the description of monthly local weather conditions for the last 500 years. The sources in this period are sufficiently rich in content to permit a summary into seven temperature classes, ranging from 3 (extremely cold) to +3 (extremely warm). For the earlier period 1000-1500, the sources can be assigned one of the three index values [-1, 0, 1]. This collection of index values was integrated by Glaser (2008) into a continuous time series, which represents the fundamental data source of the present work. Although the investigations are principally devoted to temperature reconstruction, the methods developed herein are quite general, and can equally be used to reconstruct other weather parameters from corresponding index values...
