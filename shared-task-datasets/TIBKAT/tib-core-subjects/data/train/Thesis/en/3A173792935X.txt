Untersuchungen zur Machbarkeit der Kultivierung von Drosera rotundifolia für medizinale Zwecke auf wiedervernässten Hochmoorflächen in Deutschland mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Co-Nutzung bei der Torfmooskultivierung
The round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia L.) is typical for nutrient-poor raised bogs and plays a special role in the ecosystem. In many European countries, this plant species is considered endangered or highly endangered. This can be attri- buted to three causes: 1) For decades the management and therewith drainage and fertilization of European peatlands have led to a significant decline of wet, oligotrophic and acidic habitats, which are favoured by Drosera species.  2) Already in the Middle Ages, Drosera species were used as medicinal plants mainly for the treatment of respirator y diseases (asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough etc.).  3) Cultivation experiments with Drosera species have been conducted since 1920. Nevertheless, no method for the large-scale cultivation of sundew has yet been realized to produce the quantities of the Drosera raw material required by the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, large quantities of European and non-European Drosera species are still being collected in natural peatlands.  The increasing destruction of the natural bogs and the collection for medicinal purposes together pose a serious threat to the conservation of D. rotundifolia. Sphagnum farming areas in Germany are in many respects comparable to intact raised bogs, and the nutrient-poor environment of the cultivated Sphagnum serves as a habitat for native Drosera species, such as Drosera rotundifolia L. and Drosera intermedia Hayne. Therefore, these cultivated areas offer a ...
