An experimental validation of Lorentz force eddy current testing
The adoption of metallic materials in industry and building construction is of enormous importance. To make sure, that a component is without defects and will withstand the applied loads, usually a 100% check-up is performed. Therefore, several nondestructive material testing techniques are available. Their applicability is often limited. The novel nondestructive material testing technique named "Lorentz force eddy current testing" is a contactless electromagnetic testing technique. It is capable of detecting deeply hidden defects in electrically conducting materials at high testing speeds due to the use of a direct magnetic field. Using a conceptually simple prototype model some limits of the measurement technique are presented and the basic physical principle is explained. In order to prove the functionality of the testing technique experimental data for specimens with artificial defects are presented. The measurement signal is analyzed and conclusions are used for improvement.
