Novel scheduling strategies for future NoC and MPSoC architectures
... Therefore message scheduling in TTNoCs is one of the major challenges, where the points in time for the transmission of a message with conflict-free paths through the switches are determined. As the scheduling problem is NP-complete this work introduces a novel scheduling framework based on the latest advancements of theorem solvers such as Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) techniques which have successfully been applied to problem instances of this complexity class. - In addition this work also investigates different concepts to partition the problem instances allowing the application of parallel computing to further accelerate the proposed scheduling framework. ...
