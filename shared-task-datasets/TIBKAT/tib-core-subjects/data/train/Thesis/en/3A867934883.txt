Self-assembled nanotubes and nanoribbons of aromatic diamide-esters
Zusammenfassung: Supramolecular nanostructures provide excellent opportunities to enhance our understanding of the basic mechanism of self-organization and hence to deal with the fundamental issues of nanoscale construction e.g. desired morphology and well defined size. The ability to manipulate the ordered structures at molecular scale, affected by competing intermolecular or molecule-environment interactions, provide further insight for a more fundamental understanding of ordering and growth phenomena. In particular, self-assembly of organic molecules into highly ordered nanostructures is of significant interest due to their potential applications as functional soft materials.In this context, we investigated the ordering and growth phenomena of achiral aromatic diamide molecules, which involve three distinct strongly interacting groups (SIGs) (one aromatic-ester ring and two amide groups per molecule). We demonstrated that solutions of 3,5-bis-(5-hexylcarbamoylpentyloxy)-benzoic acid decyl ester (BHPB-10), can form metastable nanostructures on solid substrates and in bulk
