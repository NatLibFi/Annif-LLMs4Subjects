Mutualistic plant-microbe interactions in Nicotiana attenuata : from bacterial communities to single players
Endosphere-inhabiting mutualistic bacteria establish intimate relationships with their host plant and often provide services like plant growth-promotion (PGP) or disease protection. How plants select for these microbes and which mechanism of PGP are employed remain mostly elusive. I assessed the relevance of plant ethylene (ET) signaling in the recruitment of culturable mutualistic bacteria to the root endosphere of the wild tobacco species Nicotiana attenuata. Wild-type (WT) and transgenic lines either deficient in ET biosynthesis (ir-aco1) or ET perception (35S-etr1) grown in native soils were employed. The bacterial diversity of N. attenuataâ€™s was strongly determined by the soil type and, to a lesser extent, by plant ET signaling. In terms of PGP, about 50% of the isolated strains conferred positive effects on seedling growth. ...
