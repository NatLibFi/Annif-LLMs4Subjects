Water quality monitoring of kettle holes by means of hyperspectral remote sensing in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern State, Germany
This research aims to present the ability of hyperspectral remote sensing (two-years field spectral data, HyMap and ROSIS sensors imagery) for kettle holes&rsquo; water quality parameters (chlorophyll, depth, total suspended sediment) mapping in agricultural young moraine landscapes in North-Eastern Germany. The objectives were to: (1) determine trophic state of several kettle holes (spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics); (2) evaluate and assess the applicability of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques to the water quality of kettle holes that are most suitable for various kettle holes.
