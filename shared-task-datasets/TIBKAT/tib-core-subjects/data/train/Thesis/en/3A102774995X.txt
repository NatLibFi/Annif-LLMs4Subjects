Propagation of single and multi-photon states in integrated laser-written waveguide networks
The propagation of single and multi-photon states in integrated waveguides arrays is analyzed. Firstly the impact of decoherence on the dynamics of a system is studied, analyzing the cases of distinguishable and indistinguishable photons. The next part covers the study of quantum suppressions, where conditions necessary for suppression of certain output distributions is investigated. Finally the implementation of a photonic quantum SWAP gate is presented. All experiments were performed through integrated photonic quantum circuits, fabricated with the femtosecond laser writing technique.<eng>
