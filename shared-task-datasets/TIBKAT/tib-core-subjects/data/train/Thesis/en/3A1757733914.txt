Functionalization of nanoporous carbon materials for chiral separation and heterogeneous oxidation catalysis
The impact that catalysis has on global economy and environment is substantial, since 85% of all chemical industrial processes are catalytic. Among those, 80% of the processes are heterogeneously catalyzed, 17% make use of homogeneous catalysts, and 3% are biocatalytic processes. Especially in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry, a significant part of these processes involves chiral compounds. Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is necessary and it is usually accomplished by asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, as well as chiral separation. The efficiency of these processes may be vastly improved if the chiral selectors are positioned on a porous solid support, thereby increasing the available surface area for chiral recognition. Similarly, the majority of commercial catalysts are also supported, usually comprising of metal nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on highly porous oxide or nanoporous carbon material. Materials that have exceptional thermal and chemical stability, and are electrically conductive are porous carbons ...
