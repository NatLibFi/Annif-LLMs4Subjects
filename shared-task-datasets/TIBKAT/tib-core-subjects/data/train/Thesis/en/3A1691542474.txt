Resolution of Tip Vortices by grid-based, grid-free and coupled methods using CFD
The vortex structure resolution is one of the vital problems of CFD as inherent artificial dissipation effects lead to an unphysical strong decay of the vortices. The overall objective of this work is to improve the resolution of concentrated vortices. This work focuses on grid based, grid free methods and coupled methods to capture the details of vortices especially further downstream after the vortex has rolled up and started to decay. The work focuses on a hybrid method as a coupling of grid based and grid free vortex method.<eng>
