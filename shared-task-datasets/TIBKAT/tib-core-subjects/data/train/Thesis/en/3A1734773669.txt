Understanding the impact of heterozygosity on metabolism, growth and hybrid necrosis within a local Arabidopsis thaliana collection site
Plants are unable to move away from unwanted environments and therefore have to locally adapt to changing conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), a model organism in plant biology, has been able to rapidly colonize a wide spectrum of environments with different biotic and abiotic challenges. In recent years, natural variation in Arabidopsis has shown to be an excellent resource to study genes underlying adaptive traits and hybridization’s impact on natural diversity. Studies on Arabidopsis hybrids have provided information on the genetic basis of hybrid incompatibilities and heterosis, as well as inheritance patterns in hybrids. However, previous studies have focused mainly on global accessions and yet much remains to be known about variation happening within a local growth habitat. In my PhD, I investigated the impact of heterozygosity at a local collection site of Arabidopsis and its role in local adaptation. I focused on two different projects, both including hybrids among Arabidopsis individuals collected around Tübingen ...
