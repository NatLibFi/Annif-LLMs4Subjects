Integrating satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements to estimate the biophysical parameters of agricultural crop using multispectral and radar data
A large portion of the earth's surface is covered with various vegetation classes (i.e. grassland, wetland and agricultural area, forest) of many diverse species and canopy configurations. The ability to assess and to monitor canopy parameters, such as biomass, leaf area index, and vegetation water content, is of vital importance to the study of different agronomic processes. Remote sensing techniques provide a unique capability towards probing different vegetation types and canopy by operating at different bands, observation angle etc. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in remote sensing techniques of land processes specially vegetation characteristics through development of advanced ground-based, airborne and space-borne microwave sensors, methods and approaches such as theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical models, needed for analyzing the data. These activities have sharply increased in recent years since the launch of different active and passive satellites and sensors. Remote Sensing (RS) science and techniques combined with ground truth data can provide new tools for advanced agricultural crop applications. It has been demonstrated that RS has the ability to estimate biophysical parameters of agricultural crops over time at local, regional, and global scales. In this study, RS images in visible/near infrared (VIS/NIR) domain as well as microwave domain combined with ground truth data were used to assess biophysical parameters of agricultural ...
