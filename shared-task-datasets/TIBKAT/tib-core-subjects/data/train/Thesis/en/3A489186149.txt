Sonochemistry of selected hydrocarbons, sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing organic compounds in aqueous solutions and nonaqueous liquids
The sonochemical products, mechanisms, kinetics, and effective factors of selected cyclic and aliphatic C6HX, thiophenes, thioethers, and N-heterocyclic compounds in aqueous solutions and nonaqueous liquids have been investigated in this work. The transfer of volatile organic substrate from bulk liquid into cavitation bubbles is essential for the sonolysis. Instead of vapor pressure, the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the volatile organic substrate dominates the mass transfer and the sonolysis. Also, most of products stem from the pyrolysis of substrate in collapsing cavitation bubbles, and the reactivity of organic substrate with the active intermediates generated in situ during the sonication, profoundly affects the sonochemical reaction in bulk liquid. Moreover, the lower initial concentration of volatile substrate is favorable to the aquasonolysis, and the low liquid temperature or low vapor pressure of substrate can enhance the sonolysis of organic liquid.
