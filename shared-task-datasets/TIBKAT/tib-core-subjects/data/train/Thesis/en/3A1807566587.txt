Bio-sourced adsorbing poly(2-oxazoline)s mimicking mussel glue proteins for antifouling applications
Nature developed countless systems for many applications. In maritime environments, several organisms established extra-ordinary mechanisms to attach to surfaces. Over the past years, the scientific interest to employ those mechanisms for coatings and long-lasting adhering materials gained significant attention. This work describes the synthesis of bio-inspired adsorbing copoly(2-oxazoline)s for surface coatings with protein repelling effects, mimicking mussel glue proteins. From a set of methoxy substituted phenyl, benzyl, and cinnamyl acids, 2-oxazoline monomers were synthesized. All synthesized 2-oxazolines were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and EI mass spectrometry. With those newly synthesized 2-oxazoline monomers and 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline, kinetic studies concerning homo- and copolymerization in a microwave reactor were conducted. The success of the polymerization reactions was demonstrated by FT-IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). [...]
