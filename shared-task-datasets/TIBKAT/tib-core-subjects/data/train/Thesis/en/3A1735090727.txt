Plant-derived transcription factors and their application for synthetic biology approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Plant-derived Transcription Factors for Orthologous Regulation of Gene Expression in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs) is central in many synthetic biology projects where tailored expression of one or multiple genes is often needed. As TFs from evolutionary distant organisms are unlikely to affect gene expression in a host of choice, they represent excellent candidates for establishing orthogonal control systems. To establish orthogonal regulators for use in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we chose TFs from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. ...
