Comparison of Rotliegend sandstone diagenesis from the northern and southern margin of the North German Basin, and implications for the importance of organic maturation and migration
Integration of results from diagenetic investigations and basin modelling indicates that major mesodiagenetic mineral reactions in deeply buried Rotliegend sandstones of the North German Basin are related to the presence or absence of underlying Carboniferous petroleum source rocks. These reactions include the bleaching of red beds, dissolution processes, and growth of cements incorporating reduced iron. Such processes are apparently absent in areas, where red beds were not affected by petroleum migration during burial.
