Approximation algorithms for network design problems
We consider different variants of network design problems. Given a set of points in the plane we search for a shortest interconnection of them. In this general formulation the problem is known as Steiner tree problem. We consider the special case of octilinear Steiner trees in the presence of hard and soft obstacles. In an octilinear Steiner tree the line segments connecting the points are allowed to run either in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. An obstacle is a connected region in the plane bounded by a simple polygon. No line segment of an octilinear Steiner tree is allowed to lie in the interior of a hard obstacle. If we intersect a Steiner tree with the interior of a soft obstacle, no connected component of the induced subtree is allowed to be longer than a given fixed length. We provide polynomial time approximation schemes for the octilinear Steiner tree problem in the presence of hard and soft obstacles. These were the first presented approximation schemes introduced for the problems. Additionally, we introduce a (2+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for soft obstacles. We then turn to Euclidean group Steiner trees. Instead of a set of fixed points we get for each point a set of potential locations (combined into groups) and we need to pick only one location of each group. The groups we consider lie inside disjoint regions fulfilling a special property so-called alpha-fatness ...
