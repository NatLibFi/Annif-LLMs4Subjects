Some classes of Markov processes on configuration spaces and their applications
In this work Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics for interacting particle systems in continuum are studied, and some applications of certain birth-and-death processes to demography are considered. The Glauber dynamics may be interpreted as a special birth-and-death process, whereas in the Kawasaki dynamics particles randomly jump over the space. Using the theory of Dirichlet forms we construct equilibrium Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics which have a Determinantal Point Process as an invariant measure. We also studied the spectral properties of the Glauber dynamics generator and achieved new results for a class of potentials, for which no conclusions could be gained before.
