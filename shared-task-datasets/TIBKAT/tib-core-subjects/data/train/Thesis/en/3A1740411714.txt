Radio observations of the host galaxies of short Gamma-Ray Bursts
Phenomenologically, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) divide into long and short, with the borderline at 2 seconds. While a physical link between long GRBs and type Ic supernovae is observationally and theoretically well established, for short bursts the observational situation is less clear. Theoretical work strongly suggests that short bursts are produced by merging neutron star (NS)-NS and NS-black hole binaries. Current observational data are not in conflict with this view but a direct observational proof of this theoretical concept has not yet been done. ...
