Photochromic coatings containing copper bromide nanocrystals and Zn2+/Cd2+ as co-activators
The present dissertation investigate a photochromic glass coating made through sol-gel process and dip coating route based on copper bromides crystals diffused on the glassy matrix instead of silver halides due to copper≈õ more intense absorption of visible light. So the darkening/fade process is influenced by crystal size, as well as by light stimulation and heat. Furthermore the crystals should have a certain degree of disorder caused by substitution of Cu ions which will optimize the charge diffusion through the crystal, i.e. the response to light stimulation (presence and absence).
