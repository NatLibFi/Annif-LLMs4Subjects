Efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate by carbon-based catalysts for water purification
The increasing global population has led to a growing demand for cost-effective and eco-friendly methods of water purification. This demand has reached a peak due to the increasing presence of impurities and pollutants in water and a growing awareness of waterborne diseases. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective methods to address these challenges, due to the generation of highly reactive radicals, such as sulfate radical (SO4•-), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and/or superoxide radical (•O2-) in oxidation reactions. Relative to conventional hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based AOPs for wastewater treatment, the persulfate-related AOPs are receiving increasing attention over the past decades, due to their stronger oxidizing capability and a wider pH working window. Further deployment of the seemingly plausible technology as an alternative for the well-established one in industry, however, necessitates a careful evaluation of compounding factors, such as water matrix effects, toxicological consequences, costs, and engineering ...
