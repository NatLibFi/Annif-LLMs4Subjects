Decompositions in doubling weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and applications
In this work we deal with atomic and wavelet decompositions in weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, where the weight functions are so-called doubling weights, which naturally extend the Muckenhoupt weights. We consider smooth atoms and smooth Daubechies wavelets both with compact supports and introduce a new approach to come in general from an atomic representation to a wavelet isomorphism. In Chapter 3 we prove sharp conditions for continuous and compact embeddings for doubling weighted Besov spaces. In Chapter 4 we study the growth envelope functions for these spaces and obtain partial results.
