Terahertz metamaterials : from fundamental coupling mechanisms to new terahertz metasurfaces and functional emitters
Zusammenfassung: The central topic of this thesis is the investigation of a new kind of optical materials, so called metamaterials. These artificially created materials consist of periodically arranged sub-wavelength sized resonant structures. Their optical properties can be designed by changing the form, size or arrangement of the sub-structures. The resonator's interaction among each other and with an incident light-field is investigated experimentally in the terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the first part of this thesis the fundamental electromagnetic interaction between one type of sub-structure, a single Split-Ring resonator, is investigated in two dimensional arrays.Then the complexity of interaction was increased by adding a second Split-Ring inside each unit cell, which results in the formation of a particular kind of resonance, a so called Fano resonance. The line-shape of this sharp asymmetrically shaped resonance was then controlled by the separation between the two resonators.In the third part a new type of optical materials is presented, a wave vector selective surface. This ultra thin structured surface can filter out waves, which arrive under oblique incident on the surface, operating effectively as a tunnel vision filter. In the last part a novel method is presented to excite resonant structures on semiconductor substrates using visible light. As one example this technique is than used as an inverse near-field microscope, to map the electromagnetic near-fields of those resonators with sub-wavelength resolution
