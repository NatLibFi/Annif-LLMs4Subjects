Robust optimal experimental design for model discrimination of kinetic ODE systems
Zusammenfassung: In this work, we present the development of a numerical algorithm, which calculates a design of experiments to allow for optimal discrimination of different hypothetic candidate models of a given dynamical system for the most inappropriate parameter configurations within a parameter range. The collectivity of design conditions is novel and motivated by a real biological experimental setup. The statistical discrimination criterion is worked out rigorously for these settings. The underlying problem can be classified as a semi-infinite optimization problem, which is solved in an Outer Approximations approach. The algorithmic framework is applied to two example problems for the calculation of optimal experimental designs. Additionally, it is applied to design a Circadian Rhythm to set its period in a robust optimal way
