The geochemistry of detrital rutile : implications for sedimentary provenance studies and the reconstruction of metamorphic conditions
Samples investigated in this study derive from a large range of metamorphic conditions (from diagenetic up to 950ʿC and 4.5GPa) and geological settings. Main sampling localities were the Variscan Erzgebirge (Germany) and the Alps (Switzerland and Italy). Other samples derive from different locations in Europe, North- and South America, and Africa. Sand samples from ca. 100m2 to ca. 2300km2 catchment areas are compared to associated rock samples. Rutile, anatase and brookite crystals with grain sizes of 63æm to cm-scale are analysed by Electron Microprobe (EMP), Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Raman Spectroscopy, and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) for trace elements, isotopes and phase composition ...
