Observables and Symmetries of n-Plectic Manifolds
Leonid Ryvkin gives a motivated and self-sustained introduction to n-plectic geometry with a special focus on symmetries. The relevant algebraic structures from scratch are developed. The author generalizes known symplectic notions, notably observables and symmetries, to the n-plectic case, culminating in solving the existence question for co-moment maps for general pre-n-plectic manifolds. Finally partial results scattered along the literature are derived from our general result.
