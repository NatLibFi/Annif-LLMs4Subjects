Multiply negatively charged aluminium clusters and fullerenes
Multiply negatively charged aluminium clusters and fullerenes were generated in a Penning trap using the "electron-bath" technique. Aluminium monoanions were generated using a laser vaporisation source. After this, two-, three- and four-times negatively charged aluminium clusters were generated for the first time. This research marks the first observation of tetra-anionic metal clusters in the gas phase. Additionally, doubly-negatively charged fullerenes were generated. The smallest fullerene dianion observed contained 70 atoms.
