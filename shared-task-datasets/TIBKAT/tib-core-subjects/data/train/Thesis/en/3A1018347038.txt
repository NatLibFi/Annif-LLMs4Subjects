Study of unsteady hydrodynamic effects in the ship stern area under shallow water conditions
The operating conditions of inland cruise vessels include small water depths, which in combination with typically high block coefficients lead to rise of parasitic vibration in the ship stern. This effect impairs the habitability and thus has to be studied so as to propose some measures of its suppression. In the present work the CFD analysis of the flow at the stern of a cruise vessel was conducted using scale-resolving simulation. Influence of different factors on the statistics of the velocity field, propeller forces, pressure oscillations and cavitation inception regions was studied.<eng>
