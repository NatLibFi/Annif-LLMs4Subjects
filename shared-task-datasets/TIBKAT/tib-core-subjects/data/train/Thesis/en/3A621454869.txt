Fast STED microscopy
The spatial resolution of optical far-field microscopes was hampered by diffraction until STED microscopy broke the diffraction limit. This thesis for the first time combines the high spatial resolution of STED microscopy with high temporal resolution to Fast STED microscopy. It heralds the study of fast dynamic processes via STED microscopy: diffraction unlimited movies with 200 images per second are recorded from colloids; video-rate imaging is achieved in living cells. In particular, the diffusion of 36 nm particles is shown at 80 frames per second (fps); the processes at the growth front of a colloidal crystal of particles as small as 200 nm are visualized at 200 fps. Biological samples are imaged and analyzed beyond the proof of principle, driven by open questions from actual biological research: it is shown that the movement of neurotransmitter vesicles encompasses low and high mobility states ...
