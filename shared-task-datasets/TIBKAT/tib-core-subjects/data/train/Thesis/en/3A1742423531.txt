Thermal radiative properties of uniaxial anisotropic materials and their manipulations
This book presents mainly studies on the calculation methods of thermal radiative properties of uniaxial anisotropic materials, unidirectional transmission, ultrabroadband perfect absorption, and near-field radiative heat transfer with uniaxial anisotropic materials. The results obtained in this book can not only deepen our understanding of the thermal radiative properties of anisotropic materials, but also have important theoretical guiding significance in energy conversion, energy-saving technology, and design of novel devices.
