Chiroptical Spectroscopy for the Monitoring of Perturbation-dependent Systems
Zusammenfassung: Chiroptical spectroscopy, including circular dichroism (CD), which probesthe differential absorbance of left (LCPL) and right circularly polarized light (RCPL),and Raman optical activity (ROA), which probes the differential Stokes scattering ofLCPL and RCPL, are usually restricted to samples in homogeneous solutions withappropriate solvents. In this work, chiroptical spectroscopy was applied for themonitoring of systems whose asymmetric structural and conformational equilibria areperturbed by parameters, such as pH, temperature, solvent, chemical modifications, orthe presence of other compounds. For this purpose, challenges regarding limitations ofsolvents and sample preparation were addressed in four different projects:First, a high output power quantum cascade laser-based vibrational CD (VCD)instrument was advanced for the application of monitoring the hydrolysis of a nickelsparteine-complex in CHCl3 and the pH-titration of an aqueous solution of the aminoacid proline.Second, a protocol for solid-phase VCD spectroscopy, allowing for the elimination ofmost macroscopic optical anisotropy effects, was developed
