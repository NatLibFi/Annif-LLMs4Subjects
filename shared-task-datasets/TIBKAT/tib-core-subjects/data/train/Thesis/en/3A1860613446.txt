High-frequency light-matter interaction in atoms and molecules
The field of attosecond science is a novel and fast-evolving research area that aims at unravelling the motion of particles in atoms, molecules, and solids. Therein, attochemistry thrives to understand, monitor, and one-day control the movement of electrons in molecules, which will open a new path to steer nuclear dynamics and photochemical reactions. In order to observe the motion of electrons, attosecond resolution and, thus, attosecond light pulses are needed. These attosecond pulses are inherently rooted in the high-frequency regime, ranging from XUV to soft and hard x-ray radiation. Depending on the energy, intensity, and aimed-at observable, different light-matter interactions can be studied. In this work, we tackle three different kinds of high-frequency light-matter interaction that originate in three different energy regimes and allow us to gain novel insight into the dynamics of molecules. In the XUV regime, the ionisation dynamics of correlated, multi-particle systems is studied together with few-cycle effects. In the soft x-ray regime, attosecond x-ray absorption is introduced as a novel tool to observe coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in a neutral molecule. In the hard x-ray regime, we focus on ultrafast, non-resonant x-ray scattering, which can be transformed into a future technology capable of observing electron dynamics. We are confident that this work will benefit the general understanding of high-frequency light-matter interaction in atoms and molecules, as well as aid and initiate new experiments in the field of attochemistry using XUV ionisation, x-ray absorption, and x-ray scattering.
