Synthesis of aromatic heterocycles by Palladium(0)-catalyzed domino reactions and cyclization of hydrazone dianions
This dissertation focuses on the development of new and convenient synthetic approaches for important or new aromatic heterocycles, namely chromeno[3,4-b]pyrrol-4(3H)-ones, indolo[1,2-f]phenanthridines, azaindolo[1,2-f]phenanthridines, naphtho-fused heterocycles, and fluorinated pyrazoles, which are potential for drug discovery and advanced materials. The approaches base on palladium(0)-catalyzed domino reactions and cyclization of hydrazone dianions.<ger>
