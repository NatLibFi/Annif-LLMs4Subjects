Electrochemical sodium storage in non-graphitizing carbons - insights into mechanisms and synthetic approaches towards high-energy density materials
To achieve a sustainable energy economy, it is necessary to turn back on the combustion of fossil fuels as a means of energy production and switch to renewable sources. However, their temporal availability does not match societal consumption needs, meaning that renewably generated energy must be stored in its main generation times and allocated during peak consumption periods. Electrochemical energy storage (EES) in general is well suited due to its infrastructural independence and scalability. The lithium ion battery (LIB) takes a special place, among EES systems due to its energy density and efficiency, but the scarcity and uneven geological occurrence of minerals and ores vital for many cell components, and hence the high and fluctuating costs will decelerate its further distribution. The sodium ion battery (SIB) is a promising successor to LIB technology, as the fundamental setup and cell chemistry is similar in the two systems. Yet, the most widespread negative electrode material in LIBs, graphite, cannot be used in SIBs, as it ...
