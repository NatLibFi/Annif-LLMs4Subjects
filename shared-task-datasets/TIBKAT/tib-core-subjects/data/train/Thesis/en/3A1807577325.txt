Design criteria for Indoor Positioning Systems in hospitals using technological, organizational and individual perspectives
This dissertation considers three different studies that handle Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) in hospitals. Study 1 uses the Reasoned Action Approach by questioning hospital visitors and employees about their intention to use IPS in hospitals. Study 2 reviews IPS in hospitals. Study 3 is based on the results of the first two studies. It handles expert interviews that were conducted with different hospitals and IPS developers to evaluate the determined propositions. Then, the insights were used to conduct and evaluate experiments by testing an ultrasound-based IPS for hospitals.<eng>
