Manipulation of near field propagation and far field radiation of surface plasmon polariton
Introduction -- Basic experimental research on surface plasmon polariton -- The principle of non-perfectly-matched Bragg diffraction and the realization of plasmonic Airy beam -- Steering surface plasmon polariton on metal surface with non-perfectly-matched Bragg diffraction -- Modulation far-field radiation with plasmonic structure -- Summary
This book mainly focuses on the study of steering electromagnetic fields in near-field and far-field contexts involving plasmonic structures. It also offers a new approach to achieving full control of optical polarizations and potentially boosting the development in photonic information processing. A new in-plane phase modulation method is proposed and described, by means of which a series of optical beams were realized with nanostructures in metal surfaces, such as a plasmonic Airy beam, broad band focusing beam, and demultiplexing, collimated beam, as well as an optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam. Further, the book presents a plasmonic polarization generator, which can reconfigure an input polarization to all kinds of states simultaneously
