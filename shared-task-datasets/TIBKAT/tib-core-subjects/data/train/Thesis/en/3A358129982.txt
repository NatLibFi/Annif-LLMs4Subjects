Marker making, Nesting, Layout, combinatorial Optimization. - A new algorithm for the solution of the marker making problem for patterned fabrics is presented. Marker making is an essential step in the process chain of cloth production. The main aim in the cutting process of fabrics is the minimization of waste. In the apparel industry cutting of patterned fabrics should be done under consideration of several constraints. An image processing system collects all necessary information about the repetition of the pattern on the fabric. This information ...
