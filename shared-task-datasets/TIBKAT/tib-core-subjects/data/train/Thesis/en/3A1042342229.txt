Dynamic coronal mass ejection processes and magnetic reconnection
The Sun is the nearest star to the Earth. It consists of an interior and an atmosphere. The convection zone is the outermost layer of the solar interior. A flux rope may emerge as a coherent structure from the convection zone into the solar atmosphere or be formed by magnetic reconnection in the atmosphere. A flux rope is a bundle of magnetic field lines twisting around an axis field line, creating a helical shape by which dense filament material can be supported against gravity. The flux rope is also considered as the key structure of the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares. These magnetic flux ropes can produce severe geomagnetic storms. In particular, to improve the ability to forecast space weather, it is important to enrich our knowledge about the dynamic formation of  flux ropes and the underlying physical mechanisms that initiate their eruption, such as a CME. A confined eruption consists of a filament eruption and usually an associated are, but does not evolve into aâ€¦
