New anode- and cathode-active materials for organic batteries
The development and synthesis of new polymers for organic batteries is a long and difficult process rife with challenges. However, the reward for this are suitable materials for the next generation of secondary batteries. The investigations within the scope of this thesis are focused on the discovery of new redox-active polymers suitable as active materials in batteries. These organic battery materials can compete with inorganic materials in terms of theoretical capacity, power and energy density. The most beneficial features of these compounds like light weight, flexibility, printability and environmental friendliness make them promising candidates for secondary organic batteries. With the vast repertoire of known redox-active species the transfer of those into a polymeric structure and their subsequent electrochemical testing can provide access to a wide variety of different electrode materials. In this thesis new polymers were developed as active battery-materials and tested for their capabilities in batteries. This includes the functionalization and optimization of well-known polymers like galvinoxyles and the incorporation of less-known redox-materials in polymeric compounds. Several new polymers, containing anode- or cathode-active compounds were synthesized. Galvinoxyl- and phenoxyl-compounds are addressed as well as quinones, anthraquinones and nitroxides. These polymeric compounds were subsequently intensively tested for their application as electrode material and incorporated into batteries, including the fabrication of a battery using inkjet-printing. By changing the functional groups of the polymers, their redox-potentials, stability or solubility are changed and new batteries were created. Those different batteries show the versatility of polymers as electrode-materials and the possibility to adjust a batteries capability to the desired specifications.
