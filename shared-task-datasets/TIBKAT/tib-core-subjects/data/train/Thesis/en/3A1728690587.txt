Identifizierung und Charakterisierung der vom Phosphoproteingen des Newcastle Disease Virus kodierten akzessorischen Proteine W und V
Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae, NDV enlarges its coding capacity by differential editing of transcripts. Due to co-transcriptional mRNA-editing the phosphoprotein gene encodes the phospho- (P), V-, and W protein. The three proteins share a common N-terminus but specify C-termini differing in length and amino acid composition. Whereas the expression and incorporation into NDV particles has been demonstrated for NDV P- and V proteins, evidence for the existence of a W protein was lacking. W-specific antipeptide sera were generated to analyze expression of the NDV W protein based on peptides located in the unique C-terminal W protein amino acid sequence that encompassed predicted antigenic sites. The corresponding rabbit sera enabled the detection of plasmid-expressed W protein as well as W protein expression during infection by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. Incorporation of W protein into viral particles was indicated by Western blot and mass spectrometric analyses. In contrast, W protein was absent in infected cells and viral particles of newly generated recombinant NDV lacking W protein expression. Absence of W protein expression was achived by two different mutational approaches. Confocal microscopic analyses revealed a nuclear accumulation of W protein of NDV in infected cells, attributed to a bipartite nuclear localization sequence within its unique C-terminal part. Functionality of the NLS was confirmed by mutation of the two basic ...
