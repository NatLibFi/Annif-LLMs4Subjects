Online monitoring system using reactor and mass spectrometry
The combination of micro reactor and analytical devices are popular in research and industry, in addition to the automation of analytical tasks. An automated system for online reaction monitoring in a micro reactor using a mass spectrometer has therefore been realized. The system offers fast data acquisition at discrete time-point in a reaction process. In addition, different functions and utilities that facilitate the convenience to users are included: A dilution module, integration of the micro reactor system to an ICP-MS, two sampling methods, a heating module and a control software.<eng>
