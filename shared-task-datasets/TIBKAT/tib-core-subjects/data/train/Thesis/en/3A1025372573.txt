Investigating the mechanism of a novel glycine-dependent riboswitch and a putative non-coding regulatory RNA in Streptococcus pyogenes
We investigated gene expression regulation by a putative glycine(Gly) riboswitch located in the 5′-UTR of a SAF protein gene in the S.pyogenes. Gly-dependency was studied using a luciferase reporter gene system. Maximal reporter gene expression happened in the presence of low Gly concentrations. RT-qPCR showed that in the presence of Gly (≥1 mM), expression of the gene was downregulated. Growth in the presence of 0.1 mM Gly led to the production of a full-length transcript. We conclude that the Gly riboswitch in S. pyogenes represses gene expression in the presence of high Gly concentrations.<eng>
