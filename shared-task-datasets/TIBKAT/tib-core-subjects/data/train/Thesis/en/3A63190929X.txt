Tree transpiration in forest plantations: effects of species, seasonality and diversity (Panama)
Forests serve many benefits worldwide such as providing renewable raw materials and energy, maintaining biodiversity and protecting land and water resources. However, they are threatened by fire, agricultural and urban expansion and various other disturbances. Especially in tropical areas the loss of forest cover is on an alarming high rate. Therefore the establishment of tree plantations in the tropics is of increasing importance to mitigate climate change by carbon sequestration and as a contribution to the growing demand for wood. Current research suggests that well designed forest plantations can reduce the volume of sediment, nutrients and salt transported into river systems. Nevertheless, there is a growing concern that tree plantations could potentially use high quantities of water. So far, most of afforestation and reforestation with tree plantations has been conducted with monocultures involving a limited number of species ...
