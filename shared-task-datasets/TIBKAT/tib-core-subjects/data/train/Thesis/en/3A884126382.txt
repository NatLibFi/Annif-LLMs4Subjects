The effectiveness of the education system for early labor market entry and mobility : a microeconometric analysis
Abstract: This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of the education system in terms of early labor market entry and mobility in Germany. Chapters B, C, and D evaluate career guidance in the form of Additional Career Assistance (ACA) for students of Lower Track Secondary Schools (LTSS) using self-collected survey and administrative data (2007-2013) in a quasi-experimental control group design. In detail, the development of occupational knowledge during school atendance (Chapter B), the effect of ACA on educational outcomes Chapter C), and the effect of ACA on the transition to apprenticeship training after leaving LTSS (Chapter D) are analysed. In addition, Chapter E analyses the effect of mobility across firms and occupations among graduates from apprenticeship training, which refers to the second threshold. Each chapter of this dissertation consists of a separate study, where the Chapters B, C, and D use self-collected and a portion of additional administrative data. The last chapter uses high-quality administrative data provided by the Institute for Employment Research. To identify the effects of interest, advanced microeconometric methods are used
