Additive manufacturing is considered a key technology for digital production. However, several barriers towards the broad industrial application exist, e.g. the associated cost and the required experience regarding the manufacturing process. To eradicate these barriers, the complete digitalization of the value creation process is needed. In this thesis, a digital, automated support structure design procedure is developed. Topology optimization is used for design rule determination, and the space colonization algorithm is adapted for the automated design. The validity of the procedure is proven experimentally, revealing sufficent mechanical performance alongside cost reduction at medium to large production scales. The content Provides a concise review of support structure optimization in laser powder bed fusion Includes thermo-mechanical material model of Ti-6Al-4V alloy Contains cost model for calculation of support-induced costs The author Katharina Bartsch studied mechanical engineering with a focus on product development, materials and production at the Technical University of Hamburg. Here, she received her doctorate in 2022 under Prof. Dr.-Ing. Claus Emmelmann (Institute for Laser and System Technologies - iLAS). During her time as a doctoral candidate, she worked as a research associate as well as chief engineer (since 2020) at the iLAS and as a team leader and research associate (since 2019) at the LZN Laser Zentrum Nord GmbH, later Fraunhofer Research Institution for Additive Production Technologies IAPT.
