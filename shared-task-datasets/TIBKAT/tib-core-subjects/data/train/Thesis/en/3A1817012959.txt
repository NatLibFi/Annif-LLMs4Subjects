Neuroendocrine and gene-based markers to evaluate the welfare challenges of the salmonid Coregonus maraena
This dissertation aimed at obtaining a range of indicators to evaluate the welfare status of C. maraena when confronted with aquaculture-related stressors. To this end, the analysis of gene expression in organs and tissues was combined with in vivo and in vitro experiments, to obtain a picture of relevant markers and their response to stressors. Overall, the present work provides an extended panel of markers to better understand how C. maraena responds to a challenging environment.<eng>
