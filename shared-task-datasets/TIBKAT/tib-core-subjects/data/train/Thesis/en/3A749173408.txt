Modular Compiler Verification : A Refinement-Algebraic Approach Advocating Stepwise Abstraction
This book presents the verified design of a code generator translating a prototypic real-time programming language to an actual microprocessor, the Inmos Transputer. Unlike most other work on compiler verification, and with particular emphasis on modularity, it systematically covers correctness of translation down to actual machine code, a necessity in the area of safety-critical systems. The formal framework provided as well as the novel proof-engineering ideas incorporated in the verified code generator are also of relevance for software design in general
