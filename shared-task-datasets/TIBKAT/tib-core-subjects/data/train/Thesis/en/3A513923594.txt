The Gabriel-Roiter measure for representation-finite hereditary algebras
The Gabriel-Roiter measure was first introduced by Gabriel (under the name 'Roiter measure', [15]) in 1973 in order to clarify the induction scheme used by Roiter in his proof of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture. But it was forgotten for nearly 30 years. Recently, Ringel showed ([28], [27]) in some way the Gabriel-Roiter measure provides a foundation for representation theory of artin algebras. The Gabriel-Roiter filtration and the Gabriel-Roiter submodule play an important role in the topic. So-called Gabriel-Roiter submodules of an indecomposable module are indecomposable submodules with a certain maximality: there do not exist proper indecomposable submodules containing a Gabriel-Roiter submodule. Gabriel-Roiter submodules of an indecomposable module Y always exist in case Y is not simple ...
