Consequences of rainforest conversion to smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations on soil trace gas fluxes from highly weathered soils in Sumatra, Indonesia
In Sumatra, Indonesia, the establishment of oil palm and rubber plantations is widespread. However, it occurs at the expense of forest area. Since global demand for palm oil and rubber is increasing, forest conversion is expected to continue. Furthermore, studies have shown that forest destruction and the establishment of agricultural land uses influence the soilâ€“atmosphere exchange of the climate-relevant trace gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Nevertheless, trace gas measurements from oil palm and rubber plantations are scarce. Additiona...
