Micro- and nanopatterning by local electrochemical lithography
The present thesis addressed the preparation of functional micro- and nanopatterns by local electrochemical lithography. Different molecules and nanoparticles could be self-assembled on the lithographic patterns to form functional systems and devices. Several technologically important materials were investigated to extend the range of substrates for the lithographic approach.
