α-Phosphanyl-α-aminosäuren : Synthese; Struktur; Eigenschaften und Reaktivität unterschiedlich N-substituierter Phosphanylglycine
The novel N-aryl phosphinoglycines are easily accessible by one-pot three-component reaction of diphenylphosphine, a primary aryl amine, and glyoxylic acid hydrate in diethyl ether. Oxidation by hydrogen peroxide or sulphur provides the respective phosphinoyl- and thiophosphinoyl glycines. The coordination properties of the phosphino group were characterized by reaction with MVI(CO)5(THF) (MVI Cr, Mo, W) and the coordination shifts in the NMR and IR spectra.
