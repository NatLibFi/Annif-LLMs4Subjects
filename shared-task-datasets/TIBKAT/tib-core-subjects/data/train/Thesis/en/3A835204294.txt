Stakeholder participation in the creation of spatial plan for Nature Park Medvednica
Zusammenfassung: Nature Park Medvednica is a mountainous protected area in central Croatia, located on the north edge of Zagreb, the countryâ€™s capital city. Nature Park is a national category of protection in which sustainable usage of resources is allowed and where the protection is set around a particularly valuable natural phenomenon. In the case of Nature Park Medvednica, the phenomenon lays in its forest habitats, which cover eight different forest phytocenosis. The legal basis for the management of nature parks are spatial plans specifically designated for those areas, from which more detailed and non-legally binding management plans are to be established.  Spatial plans come to power when they are ratified by the Parliament, and in the case of NP Medvednica the practical spatial planning was done by the local administration of the City of Zagreb
