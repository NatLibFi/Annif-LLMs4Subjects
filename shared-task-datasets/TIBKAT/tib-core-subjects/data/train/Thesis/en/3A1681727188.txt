Polymer-Mediated Phase Stability of Colloids
Colloid–polymer mixtures are subject of intensive research due to their wide range of applicability, for instance in coatings and food-stuffs. This thesis constitutes a fundamental investigation towards a better control over the stability of such suspensions. Through the chapters, different key parameters governing the stability of colloid–polymer mixtures are explored. How the colloid (pigment) shape and the effective polymer-colloid affinity modulate the stability of the suspension are examples of these key parameters. Despise the mostly theoretical results presented, the thesis is written in a format accessible to a broad scientific audience. Some of the equations of state presented might of direct use to experimentalists. Furthermore, new theoretical insights about colloid–polymer mixtures are put forward. These include four-phase coexistences in effective two-component, quantification of depletant partitioning at high colloidal concentrations, multiple re-entrant phase behaviour of the colloidal fluid–solid coexistence, and a condition where polymers are neither depleted nor adsorbed from/to the colloidal surface
