Liana regeneration in secondary and primary forests of Central Amazonia
Lianas are an important component of tropical forests. Despite their moderate contribution to forest biomass and diversity, they have a strong influence on forest dynamics. Lianas are particularly abundant in disturbed forest areas such as forest edges and small fragments, tree-fall gaps, and secondary forests. Because old growth forests are becoming more fragmented and the area covered by secondary forests is increasing, the importance of lianas is expected to increase. Studies of liana communities in forests mainly focus on stem densities of mature ascending plants. Data on liana seeds, seedlings, saplings and sprouts are scarce, but regeneration is implicated in ecological processes of all scales and may indicate future vegetation. Thus, knowledge about liana regeneration can be useful in forest management and conservation ...
