Aim of this study was to examine the mass loss and element release of soldered and laser welded dental alloys. The casting alloys were two high noble alloys (Orplid H and Orplid Keramik 4), one Ni-Cr alloy (Remanium CS) and one Co-Cr alloy (Remanium 2000). 21 specimens of each alloy were produced. 7 of them were just casted (control group), 7 were soldered and 7 were welded by laser. These groups of seven were deposited in artificial saliva and placed in an incubator by 37ʿ C for 7 days. Before and afterwards the specimens were weight by a precision balance and the loss of weight was documented. The artificial saliva was explored by Atomabsorptionsspectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. The control group of all alloys showed the best results. The laser welded samples of Orplid H and REM CS doubled their corrosion rate, Orplid Keramik 4 and REM 2000 lost almost 8 times more of their weight. The worst results were achieved by the soldered specimens ...
