Phosphoproteome analysis of the near-haploid cell line HAP1 reveals phosphorylation events originating from PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (PBK/TOPK)
PBK is a serine/threonine kinase. During mitosis, PBK phosphorylates the inter-zinc finger linker sequence (TGEKP) of hundreds of C2H2 zinc finger proteins and liberates these transcription factors from the condensing chromatin. This study aimed to investigate PBK-dependent phosphorylation events by analyzing the phosphoproteome of both wild and PBK knockout HAP1 cells. The analysis identified candidates belong to DNA- and RNA binding proteins (ADNP and FUBP1) or dynamic regulators of cell organelles (MARCKS and PGRMC1).<eng>
