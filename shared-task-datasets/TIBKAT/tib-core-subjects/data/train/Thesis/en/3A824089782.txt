Ground-based transmission spectroscopy of three inflated Hot Jupiter exoplanets
The characterization of exoplanets is a young and rapidly expanding field in astronomy. It includes a method called transmission spectroscopy that searches for planetary spectral fingerprints in the light received from the host star during the event of a transit. This techniques allows for conclusions on the atmospheric composition at the terminator region, the boundary between the day and night side of the planet. Observationally a big challenge, first attempts in the community have been successful in the detection of several absorption features in the optical wavelength range. These are for example a Rayleighscattering slope and absorption by sodium and potassium. However, other objects show a featureless spectrum indicative for a cloud or haze layer of condensates masking the probable atmospheric layers...
