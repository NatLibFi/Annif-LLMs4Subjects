Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy techniques to quantify molecular interactions and dynamics in complex biological systems
Living cells rely on transport and interaction of biomolecules to perform their diverse functions. A powerful toolbox to study these highly dynamic processes in the native environment is provided by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) techniques. In more detail, FFS takes advantage of the inherent dynamics present in biological systems, such as diffusion, to infer molecular parameters from fluctuations of the signal emitted by an ensemble of fluorescently tagged molecules. In particular, two parameters are accessible: the concentration of molecules and their transit times through the observation volume. In addition, molecular interactions can be measured by analyzing the average signal emitted per molecule - the molecular brightness - and the cross-correlation of signals detected from differently tagged species. In the present work, several FFS techniques were implemented and applied in different biological contexts. In particular, scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) was performed to measure protein dynamics ...
