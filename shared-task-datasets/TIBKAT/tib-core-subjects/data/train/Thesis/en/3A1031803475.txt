Analysis of Teukolsky equations on slowly rotating Kerr spacetimes
In this thesis, we treat the extreme Newman-Penrose components of  both the Maxwell field (s=±1) and the linearized gravitational perturbations (or "linearized gravity" for short) (s=±2) in the exterior of a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. Upon different rescalings, we can obtain spin s components which satisfy the separable Teukolsky master equation (TME). For each of these spin s components defined in Kinnersley tetrad, the resulting equations by performing some first-order differential operator on it once and twice (twice only for s=±2), together with the TME, are in the form of an "inhomogeneous spin-weighted wave equation" (ISWWE) with different potentials and constitute a linear spin-weighted wave system. We then prove energy and integrated local energy decay (Morawetz) estimates for this type of ISWWE, and utilize them to achieve both a uniform bound of a positive definite energy and a Morawetz estimate for the regular extreme Newman-Penrose components defined in the regular Hawking-Hartle tetrad. We also present some brief discussions on mode stability for TME for the case of real frequencies. This says that in a fixed subextremal Kerr spacetime, there is no nontrivial separated mode solutions to TME which are purely ingoing at horizon and purely outgoing at infinity. This yields a representation formula for solutions to inhomogeneous Teukolsky equations, and will play a crucial role in generalizing the above energy and Morawetz estimates results to the full subextremal Kerr case.
