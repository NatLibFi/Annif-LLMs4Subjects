Statistical methods of strategic portfolio management for fund of funds
A “fund of funds (FoF)” is an investment fund that invests in other investment funds rather than investing directly in shares, bonds, or other securities. Sometimes referred to as multi-manager funds, these investment funds pose - apart from the challenges that arise for every portfolio to be managed - special problems to their management teams. Most of those must be addressed with appropriate statistical or mathematical methods. We show how this may be done, using - among others - both state-of-the-art tools like post-modern portfolio optimization as well as using accessible and comprehensive representations.
