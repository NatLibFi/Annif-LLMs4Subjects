Investigating human population structure through time with new computational methods and ancient DNA data
The revolution of sequencing technology has brought an exponential increase in the production of genomic data. This thesis tackles global and continental questions on human demographic history from two directions using genetic data. Manuscript A provides a novel analytical method for estimating migration rate and effective population size utilizing highcoverage whole genome sequences, while manuscript B and C reveal the history of population movement and interactions by directly analyzing genome-wide data from ancient individuals.
