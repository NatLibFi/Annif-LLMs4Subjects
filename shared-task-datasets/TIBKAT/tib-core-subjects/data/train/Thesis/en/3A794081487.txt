Interaktion zwischen fl√ºssigem Silicium und mit Siliciumnitrid beschichtetem Quarz
Zusammenfassung: The topic of the presented work is the directional solidification of silicon for photovoltaic applications. The solidification of silicon is done in fused silica crucibles which are coated with silicon nitride. By the application of silicon nitride the sticking of silicon to the crucible is prevented. The sticking of the silicon can cause complete failure of the crystallization. The drawbacks are the impurities in Si3N4 and SiO2 which reduce the silicon material quality near the crucible. Aim of the presented work was to study the interaction between the silicon and coated quartz crucible. The work is divided into two major topics
