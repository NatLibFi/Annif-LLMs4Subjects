Transition metal-catalyzed carbonylation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles via C-H activation
The dissertation is mainly concerned with the development of transition metal-catalyzed carbonylation of nitrogen-containing compounds via C-H activation. We have described a palladium-catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic C-H bonds with alcohols using Mo(CO)6. We synthesized 3-methyleneisoindolin-1-ones and 2-phenylisoindolin-1-ones via C-H carbonylation using Mo(CO)6. A convenient procedure for the synthesis of 3-acylindoles has been established via C-H carbonylation. Furthermore, we have described a copper-catalyzed double carbonylation reaction using C6O6âˆ™8H2O.<eng>
