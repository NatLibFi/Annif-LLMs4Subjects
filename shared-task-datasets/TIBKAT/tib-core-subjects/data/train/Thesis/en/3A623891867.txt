Therefore effective processes are necessary, in order to cope with the increased requirements by the end users and the high cost- and time- pressure. Whereas usability-testing is mostly standardized for stationary systems, mobile systems face new challenges according to their heterogeneity. This dissertation seeks to improve the design and development in order to provide intuitive and innovative mobile systems by strengthening the consideration of the user's requirements as well as the context of use within early stages of the design process. The core contribution is the development and evaluation of a tool-based process-model consisting of a phase-model and an rapid-prototyping- and usability-testing- instrument. It enables a) to develop prototypes and perform usability-tests in early product stages, b) usability-testing within the native context of use and on real devices, and c) to collect valuable data. Additional features are remote observation and simulation in terms of the Wizard-of-Oz- method. The empirical studies confirmed the concept of the tool-based process-model and showed a close connection between rapid-prototyping and usability-testing.
