(In)appropriate online behavior : a pragmatic analysis of message board relations
This descriptive and comprehensive study on the discursive struggle over interpersonal relations in online message boards is located at the fascinating interface of pragmatics and computer-mediated discourse - a research area which has so far not attracted much scientific interest.
