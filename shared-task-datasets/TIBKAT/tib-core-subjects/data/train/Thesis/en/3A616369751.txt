Surface modification by deposition and thermal decomposition of transition metal cluster halides
In this work the use of metal-rich niobium halide cluster compounds with the formula M4[Nb6Cl18] (M = Na, K or Rb) as precursor to achieve pure metallic niobium particles on the surface of a variety of metallic and non-metallic substrates has been investigated. To that effect, the influence on the particle size and morphology of the different deposition and decomposition methods as well as the precursor materials has been studied. This niobium coating is intended to modify the properties of the bulk material used as substrate, especially mechanical and thermal properties.
