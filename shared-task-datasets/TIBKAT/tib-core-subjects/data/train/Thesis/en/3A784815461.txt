Reconstruction of Asian monsoon using compound-specific isotope signals of aquatic and terrestrial biomarkers in Tibetan lake systems
The general aim of this thesis was the reconstruction of the Indian Ocean summer monsoon (IOSM) dynamics using compound-specific isotope signals of aquatic and terrestrial biomarkers in Tibetan lake systems. Monsoon winds and precipitation can be retraced using different proxies, indirect climate indicators, which reflect the environmental factors in a known way. To assure the proper application of compound-specific δD values as monsoon proxy, the biological origin of sedimentary n-alkanes, their source waters and climatic relevant parameters influencing the δD values have been investigated at the Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, the utility of GDGTs as additional paleoclimate proxy for the Monsoon reconstruction has been analyzed.  ...
