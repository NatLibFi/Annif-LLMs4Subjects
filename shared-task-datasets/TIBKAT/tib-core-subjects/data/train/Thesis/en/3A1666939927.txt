Sustainable electrode materials based on lignin
The utilization of lignin as renewable electrode material for electrochemical energy storage is a sustainable approach for future batteries and supercapacitors. The composite electrode was fabricated from Kraft lignin and conductive carbon and the charge storage contribution was determined in terms of electrical double layer (EDL) and redox reactions. The important factors at play for achieving high faradaic charge storage capacity contribute to high surface area, accessibility of redox sites in lignin and their interaction with conductive additives. A thinner layer of lignin covering the high surface area of carbon facilitates the electron transfer process with a shorter pathway from the active sites of nonconductive lignin to the current collector leading to the improvement of faradaic charge storage capacity. Composite electrodes from lignin and carbon would be even more sustainable if the fluorinated binder can be omitted. A new route to fabricate a binder-free composite electrode from Kraft lignin and high surface area carbon ...
