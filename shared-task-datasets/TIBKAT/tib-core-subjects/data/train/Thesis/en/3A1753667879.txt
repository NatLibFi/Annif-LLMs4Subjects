‘Smart’ Janus emulsions : preparation, characterization, and application as a template for aerogel preparation
Emulsions constitute one of the most prominent and continuously evolving research areas in Colloid Chemistry, which involves the preparation of mixtures or dispersions of immiscible components in a continuous medium. Besides conventional oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, other emulsions of complex droplet morphologies have recently attracted significant research interests. Especially Janus emulsions, in which each droplet is comprised of two distinct sub-regions, have shown versatile potential applications. One of their advantages is the possibility of compartmentalization, which enables to play with two different chemistries in a single droplet. Though microfluidic methods are conventionally used to prepare Janus emulsions, their industrial applications are largely hindered by low throughput and extensive instrumentations. Recently, it has been discovered that simply one-pot moderate/high energy emulsification is also capable of developing Janus morphology, although their preparation and stabilization remain rather ...
