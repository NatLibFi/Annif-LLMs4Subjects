Fully kinetic PiC simulations of current sheet instabilities for the solar corona
The plasma of the Solar corona is practically collisionless. This imposes an important role of waves and micro-turbulent interactions with particles for plasma transport, dissipation, stability, etc, since binary particles collisions are inefficient. As a result the Solar corona is also a natural laboratory for testing basic plasma turbulent phenomena. Current sheets (CS), through which magnetic energy can be released, are ubiquitous in this environment. Different from many other plasmas, the presence of large guide magnetic fields plays a crucial role in the corona. In general, CS are pron...
