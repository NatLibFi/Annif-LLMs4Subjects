Integrated hydrological and mass balance assessment in a German lowland catchment with a coupled hydrologic and hydraulic modelling
Data analysis with simple parameterization techniques (hydrograph separation methods and Darcy law) was conducted in the Augraben River catchment to divide the total surface flow into base flow and quick flow. An integrated coupled hydrological and hydraulic model (MIKE SHE and MIKE 11) is used to quantify the meteorological eï¬€ects on water balance components and the exchange of groundwater and surface water. Hydrological modeling results in combination with limited available water quality data is used to estimate the hydrology and water quality variations at a sub-catchment scale.<eng>
