Modification of K0s and Lambda(AntiLambda) Transverse Momentum Spectra in Pb-Pb Collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV with ALICE
Introduction -- Problem Statement: Modiﬁcation of pT Spectra in AA Collisions -- The ALICE Experiment -- Analysis: Reconstruction of Ks0 and Λ(Λ) Transverse Momentum Spectra -- Results -- Discussion.
This thesis offers an excellent, comprehensive introduction to the physics of the quark–gluon plasma. It clearly explains the connection between theory and experiment, making the topic accessible to non-specialists in this field. The experimental work, which contributes significantly to our understanding of the quark–gluon plasma, is described in great detail. The results described in the final chapters of the thesis provide interesting new ideas about the connection between proton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions. Simone Schuchmann received the 'ALICE Thesis Award 2016' for this excellent work. .
