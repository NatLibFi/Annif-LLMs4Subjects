Combinatorial curvatures, group actions, and colourings: aspects of topological combinatorics
The first part asks whether classical notions of curvature known from differential geometry can be carried over to discrete structures. Of particular interest are analogies on a structural level; questions of convergence are not considered. Chapter 1 is motivated by constructions well-known in differential geometry. The basic object, a difference operator, makes the computation of a discrete analogue of the rough Laplacian and of the Riemannian curvature tensor possible. A trace of the latter yields a discrete notion of Ricci curvature. Applications to the objects introduced in chapter 1 are discussed in chapter 2. The first application is the proof of a combinatorial formula of Weitzenböck-type that coincides with a decomposition of Weitzenböck-type postulated by Forman in many cases. Second, a combinatorial version of the theorem due to Gauß and Bonnet is proved for combinatorial 2-manifolds. For this theorem a special choice of weights has to be assigned to the cells that yield a Weitzenböck-formula different from the one postulated by Forman. The following sections discuss whether Forman's combinatorial version of a theorem of Bochner for 1-chains can be generalised to the weighted notion of Ricci curvature introduced in chapter 1 ar to p-chains with p>1. The chapter ends with a generalisation of Forman's diameter estimate to the weighted notion of Ricci curvature and simple examples show that his approach is indeed generalised. Part 2 asks for lower bounds for the chromatic number of graphs and hypergraphs obtained using topological methods ...
