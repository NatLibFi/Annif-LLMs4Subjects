Phase behavior of liquid crystals in confinement
We use computer simulations to investigate the isotropic-to-nematic phase transition of liquid crystals. Using the Lebwohl-Lasher model with sophisticated algorithms, the phase transition is found to match experimental results and is weakly first-order in bulk. By changing the strength of a microscopic detail we show the macroscopic phase transition can be made more strongly first-order. Our simulations are made more complicated by adding planar confinement and quenched disorder. In both cases, depending on the microscopic detail, the possible phase behaviors are a first-order phase transition, a continuous phase transition, or no phase transition at all.
