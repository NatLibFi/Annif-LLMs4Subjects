How ideas change markets : social and semantic construction(s) of automobility in 21st century Europe
Recent scandals have revealed how the European car industry struggles with environmental regulation and increasing global competition. Based on an in-depth case study this book explains how locked-in structures of private fossil-fuel based mobility could persist in an ever more integrated European government of sustainable transport. Based on new theoretical and empirical insights, the author shows which joint decision-making processes and narratives are needed to foster the sector's transition towards new, shared solutions of electro-mobility.
