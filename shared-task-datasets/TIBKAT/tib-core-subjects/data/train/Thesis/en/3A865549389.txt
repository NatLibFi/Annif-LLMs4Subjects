Advanced centrifugal microfluidics : timing, aliquoting and volume reduction
Zusammenfassung: Diagnostics and analytics can be fundamentally improved by automation, miniaturization and parallelization. A tool to enable automation, miniaturization and parallelization highly efficiently in compact and easy to use instruments is centrifugal microfluidics. With recent advances the field of centrifugal microfluidics has become more attractive than ever for the integration of complex laboratory workflows. This thesis introduces advanced centrifugal microfluidic unit operations and process chains for fluidic automation in three areas of centrifugal microfluidics:-Volume reduction, allowing handling of volumes down to 40 nl within a new process chain for aliquoting and combination of three liquids in 20 different target ratios. The process chain is applied for preparation of protein samples in small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). -Parallel multi-liquid aliquoting, which allows the parallel aliquoting of two liquids and subsequent pairwise combination of these aliquots in a single fluidic layer, and-a new unit operation for timing of pumping and valving events, largely independent of the rotational frequency protocol
