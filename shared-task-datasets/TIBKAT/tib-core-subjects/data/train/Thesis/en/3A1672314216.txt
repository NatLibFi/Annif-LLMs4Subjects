Base metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of formic acid and alcohols
The content of this thesis is about base metal catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions and it contains two parts. In the first part, a cobalt catalyzed formic acid dehydrogenation in aqueous media is disclosed. The second part deals with a manganese catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols which was developed by in-situ combination of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with phosphine free oxamide ligands.<eng>
