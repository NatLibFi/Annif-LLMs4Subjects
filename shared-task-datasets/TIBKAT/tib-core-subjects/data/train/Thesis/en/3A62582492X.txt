Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of the basidiomycetes Coprinopsis cinerea and Pleurotus ostreatus : submerged and solid state fermentation, morphological studies of liquid cultures and characterisation of new laccases
Organisms produce ligninolytic enzymes in order to degrade lignocellulosic materials. Mainly, such enzymes are found in the fungal kingdom and are particularly widespread in the phylum Basidiomycota. The ligninolytic system of fungi consists of peroxidases (manganese peroxidases - MnP, lignin peroxidases - LiP and versatile peroxidases - VP) and laccases which for substrate degradation are secreted by the fungus into the environment. Laccases as main representative of the ligninolytic system can be used for delignification and bleaching in the pulp and paper industry, in the production of wood composites and to alter wood properties ...
