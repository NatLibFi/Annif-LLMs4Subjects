Automated verification of system requirements and software specifications
Zusammenfassung: Many small to medium-sized enterprises that specialise in electrical or communications engineering are challenged by the increasing importance of software in their – often safety-critical – products. For this reason they have a strong interest in subcontracting competent partners for software development tasks. Yet, many of those enterprises refrain from subcontracting because they assessthe associated risks as too high. This thesis presents a set of methods and tools based on formal methods that are useful in reducing those associated risks. We are concerned with software-defined systems, i.e., systems whose behaviour is solely controlled by a program and the input the program receives from the environment. We especially focus on systems whose controlling programaccesses its hardware via memory-mapped I/O.We present a method for validating requirements between stakeholders with different levels of expertise. Based on validated requirements, we present the IRS -method that reduces the problem of deciding whether a software-defined system satisfies the requirements to the problem of whether the controlling program satisfies its specification. We show the feasibility of the IRS -method through an industrial case-study. The case-study uses a class of state-of-the-art tools for proving program correctness (deductive verifiers)
