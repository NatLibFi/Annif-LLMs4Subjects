Technical optimization of biogas plants to deliver demand oriented power
The increasing share of alternating renewable energies introduces the necessity of flexible power. Biogas plants can provide this, but are currently designed to provide base load. Flexible power can be optimized by changing the current continuous feeding to feeding on demand where the plant is fed according to load requirements. Three technical aspects were identified in this thesis to improve the flexible power potential of existing plants using feeding on demand; online monitoring, improved gas volume measurements and feeding model. These were implemented in a full-scale biogas plant.<eng>
