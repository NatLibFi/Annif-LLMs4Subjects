Chapter 5. Forecasting and Policy Making ¤ Policymakers use forecasts to project the consequences of particular policy decisions for certain policy targets. This chapter investigates the use of economic forecasting in policy making by discussing practical examples, providing new empirical evidence and computing forecasts using different macroeconomic models. First, a theoretical framework is presented to differentiate the role of forecasts in simple feedback rules, optimal control policies, and forecast targeting. Then, we review institutional details of the forecasting process at fiscal authorities and central banks. We provide empirical evidence that central bank policy rate decisions in the United States and the Euro area are well described by interest rate rules responding to forecasts of inflation and economic activity rather than recent outcomes. Next, we provide a detailed exposition of methods for producing forecasts. We review forecasting models and provide practical applications. In particular, we illustrate how to use economic structure in interpreting forecasts and how to implement different conditioning assumptions regarding certain planned policy initiatives. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of central bank and expert forecasts and investigate the interaction between forecasting and policy making by evaluating the performance and robustness of forecast-based policy rules under model uncertainty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 13 Environment, Uncertainty, and Option Values ¤ We analyze in this chapter decision-making when costs and benefits of an action are uncertain, that is, when future preferences are uncertain. We begin, in Section 2, with the classical analysis by Krutilla et al. (1972) of whether the expected consumer's surplus is a correct measure of the net benefits from the action. It turns out that for one individual, the correct measure is the expected consumer's surplus corrected with one term representing the covariance between the state-contingent consumer's surplus and the state-contingent marginal utility of wealth and a second term representing risk aversion. This corrected measure is what Krutilla et al. (1972) called the option value. Thus the difference between option value and expected consumer's surplus is determined by the covariance between preferences and consumer's surplus and risk aversion. The sign of this difference will therefore depend on these factors. We apply this result to a number of cases in order to derive additional useful results. First we look at the aggregate (over a set of individuals) option value and establish a general result. We then apply this result to the allocation of risk in the context of both public and private goods. In Section 3, we introduce relevant dynamic elements to the general problem of decisions under uncertainty. We analyze actions that may have irreversible effects, but where the decision-maker can improve her information about the true future preferences. This problem was first studied by Arrow and Fisher (1974) and Henry (1974), who showed (as we do in Section 3.2) that when the decision-maker has to choose between two actions, of which one is irreversible, and future benefits are uncertain in the first time period, maximizing expected value will result in a biased result: the irreversible action will be chosen too often. However, this result is based on assumptions of linearity. In order to study the problem without this restriction, we rely on Epstein's (1980) framework, which we present in some detail. The result is that convexity (concavity) assumptions are essential to establish the direction of the bias. We also use Epstein's framework to look at issues such as uncertainty about cost of restoration and uncertainty about irreversibility. All of the results to this point are for models with just two time periods. In Section 4, we analyze the many-period case, adopting a somewhat different analytical framework: stochastic dynamic programming, as presented in Dixit and Pindyck (1994). Additional results in continuous time are developed, drawing on the theory of stochastic processes. We look in particular at the optimal stopping problem, a useful and important special case, and present an empirical application due to Conrad (1997): when, if ever, to cut an old-growth forest that also yields benefits in its natural state.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061616-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9>
Chapter 8 Artificial intelligence in economics and finance: A state of the art — 1994 : The real estate price and assets and liability analysis case ¤ This chapter emphasizes specific contributions, advantages, and weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques various purposes: (1) knowledge-based reasoning that applies heuristic knowledge to make policy search more robust, or to satisfy trading principles in a competitive economy, (2) machine learning to learn the behavior of economic agents, (3) decision rationalization in decision support systems, and case-based reasoning, and (4) integration of databases and knowledge bases via suitable knowledge representations. In the real world of economic analysis, AI approaches must be scalable and tunable to changing characteristics without having to change the underlying techniques or algorithms. In economic applications, better explanation-based interfaces are necessary between the user and the system. From the perspective of business, almost no AI research addresses economic competition theories, either with reference to game theory, or to disequilibrium theories. The strongest potential of some AI techniques lies in their data/information fusion capability, which is little explored. This holds especially for neural networks, case-based reasoning, and knowledge representation standards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 6 Sectoral economics ¤ This chapter discusses a common set of methods that are not currently in wide use in either microeconomics or macroeconomics, but constitute a core of the methodology for models in many different sectors of the economy. The chapter also provides an overview of the varieties of sectoral models, and discusses the ways in which some of the methods of sectoral economics can be used to great advantage in microeconomics or macroeconomics. It is now possible to estimate entire models and to solve these models using nonlinear programming or stochastic control theory methods. These methods permit the consideration of accurate models and the inclusion in the analysis of the effects of uncertainty. The progress in sectoral modeling is based on the foundation of earlier work in activity analysis, linear programming, and the solution of models with economies of scale that permits the development and solution of realistic models with many commodities, processes, productive units, plants, and markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 5. Heterogeneous Agent Models in Finance ¤ This chapter surveys the state-of-art of heterogeneous agent models (HAMs) in finance using a jointly theoretical and empirical analysis, combined with numerical analysis from the latest development in computational finance. It provides supporting evidence on the explanatory power of HAMs to various stylized facts and market anomalies through model calibration, estimation, and economic mechanisms analysis. It presents HAMs with the mainstream finance a unified framework in continuous time to study the impact of historical price information on price dynamics, profitability and optimality of fundamental and momentum trading. It demonstrates how HAMs can help to understand stock price co-movements and evolutionary CAPM. It also introduces a new HAMs perspective on house price dynamics and an integrate approach to study dynamics of limit order markets. The survey provides further insights into the complexity and efficiency of financial markets and policy implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Retail Instruments in Public Funding Strategies ¤ Retail borrowing programmes are one component of government debt issuance in both OECD and non-OECD countries. These programmes take a variety of forms and often exist to satisfy a number of objectives. In some jurisdictions, they play a significant funding role. Even in countries where retail borrowing programmes play a small role, they are in many cases politically important because they satisfy primarily social objectives. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to reconsider their retail borrowing programmes. Shrinking borrowing requirements in a number of countries have led to priority being put on maintaining liquid wholesale markets. Other countries continue to see benefits from their retail borrowing programmes and use them as a significant and stable source of funding. These governments are often innovative at finding ways to drive down administration costs, such as through the use of new electronic distribution channels and total dematerialisation of securities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 15 Volatility and Correlation Forecasting ¤ Volatility has been one of the most active and successful areas of research in time series econometrics and economic forecasting in recent decades. This chapter provides a selective survey of the most important theoretical developments and empirical insights to emerge from this burgeoning literature, with a distinct focus on forecasting applications. Volatility is inherently latent, and Section 1 begins with a brief intuitive account of various key volatility concepts. Section 2 then discusses a series of different economic situations in which volatility plays a crucial role, ranging from the use of volatility forecasts in portfolio allocation to density forecasting in risk management. Sections 3–5 present a variety of alternative procedures for univariate volatility modeling and forecasting based on the GARCH, stochastic volatility and realized volatility paradigms, respectively. Section 6 extends the discussion to the multivariate problem of forecasting conditional covariances and correlations, and Section 7 discusses volatility forecast evaluation methods in both univariate and multivariate cases. Section 8 concludes briefly.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 8 Forecasting economic variables with nonlinear models ¤ The topic of this chapter is forecasting with nonlinear models. First, a number of well-known nonlinear models are introduced and their properties discussed. These include the smooth transition regression model, the switching regression model whose univariate counterpart is called threshold autoregressive model, the Markov-switching or hidden Markov regression model, the artificial neural network model, and a couple of other models. Many of these nonlinear models nest a linear model. For this reason, it is advisable to test linearity before estimating the nonlinear model one thinks will fit the data. A number of linearity tests are discussed. These form a part of model specification: the remaining steps of nonlinear model building are parameter estimation and evaluation that are also briefly considered. There are two possibilities of generating forecasts from nonlinear models. Sometimes it is possible to use analytical formulas as in linear models. In many other cases, however, forecasts more than one periods ahead have to be generated numerically. Methods for doing that are presented and compared. The accuracy of point forecasts can be compared using various criteria and statistical tests. Some of these tests have the property that they are not applicable when one of the two models under comparison nests the other one. Tests that have been developed in order to work in this situation are described. The chapter also contains a simulation study showing how, in some situations, forecasts from a correctly specified nonlinear model may be inferior to ones from a certain linear model. There exist relatively large studies in which the forecasting performance of nonlinear models is compared with that of linear models using actual macroeconomic series. Main features of some such studies are briefly presented and lessons from them described. In general, no dominant nonlinear (or linear) model has emerged.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 3. The Theory of Risk and Risk Aversion ¤ Risk and risk aversion are important concepts when modeling how to choose from or rank a set of random variables. This chapter reviews and summarizes the definitions and related findings concerning risk aversion and risk in both a mean-variance and an expected utility decision model context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1>
A Public Debt Management Perspective on Proposals for Restrictions on Short Selling of Sovereign Debt ¤ New restrictions on short-selling sovereign debt need to be supported by concrete evidence that links systematically unrestricted short-selling activities to fraud, abuse or market manipulation. OECD debt managers noted that there is plenty of empirical evidence on the benefits of short selling, including more liquidity, pricing efficiency and better allocated risk. However, solid evidence in the form of empirical data on market instability unambiguously caused by unrestricted short-selling activities (to be counted as ‘costs’) seems to be lacking. Debt managers also noted that the reporting requirements will be costly from a purely administrative point of view. A ban on uncovered short selling transactions of sovereign debt would make risk management more difficult and expensive, with detrimental effects on market efficiency, liquidity and funding costs for sovereigns. Moreover, it is unlikely that such bans would have a stabilising effect in government securities markets during a crisis. Rather than containing the crisis, a ban on short selling of government debt is likely to worsen the situation. The paper concludes that OECD debt managers have a range of tested tools at their disposal for dealing with temporary or chronic dysfunctional measures in sovereign debt markets, ranging from ‘quantity measures’, such as openings, to ‘pricing measures’ such as dynamic fails charges.

Chapter 5. Population, Poverty, and the Natural Environment ¤ This chapter studies the interface in poor countries of population growth, rural poverty, and deterioration of the local natural-resource base, a subject that has been much neglected by modern demographers and development economists. The motivations for procreation in rural communities of the poorest regions of the world are analyzed, and recent work on the relevance of gender relationships to such motivations is summarized. Four potentially significant social externalities associated with fertility behavior and use of the local natural-resource base are identified. Three are shown to be pronatalist in their effects, while the fourth is shown to be ambiguous, in that it can be either pro-or anti-natalist. It is shown that one of the externalities may even provide an invidious link between fertility decisions and the use of the local natural-resource base. The fourth type of externality is used to develop a theory of fertility transitions in the contemporary world. The theory views such transitions as disequilibrium phenomena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8>
Financial Markets Highlights November 2007 ¤ Over the summer, financial markets weakened substantially as some of the risks that had built up during a period of easy financing, in particular in the housing market, materialised.

Chapter 2 Computation of equilibria in finite games ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the latest state of the art of methods for numerical computation of Nash equilibria and refinements of Nash equilibria for general finite n -person games. The appropriate method for computing Nash equilibria for a game depends on a number of factors. The first and most important factor involves, whether it is required to simply find one equilibrium (a sample equilibrium), or find all equilibria. The problem of finding one equilibrium is a well studied problem, and there exist number of different methods for numerically computing a sample equilibrium. The problem of finding all equilibria has been addressed recently. While, there exist methods for computation of all equilibria, they are computationally intensive. With current methods, they are only feasible on small problems. The chapter overviews methods for computing sample equilibria in normal form games, and discusses the computation of equilibria on extensive form games.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Chapter 10. Levels of Reasoning in Keynesian Beauty Contests: A Generative Framework ¤ We introduce a generalization of the Beauty Contest (BC) game as a framework that incorporates different models from micro- and macroeconomics by formulating their reduced forms as special cases of the BC. Examples include public good games, ultimatum games, Bertrand, Cournot, some auctions, asset markets, New-Keynesian, and general equilibrium models with sentiments/animal spirits. This becomes feasible by considering BC specifications with a best response or optimal action as a function of other players' aggregated actions. For characterizing an integrated account of heterogeneity in economics, as observed in BC experiments, we employ a non-equilibrium model, the so-called “level-k” model, based on one (or more) reference point(s) and (limited) iterated best responses. Level-k and related models thus bridge the gap between non-strategic (e.g. irrational, intuitive or random) behavior and equilibrium choices. We also give a brief overview of interactive decision-making within experimental economics, and discuss elicitation methods, cognitive and population measures, to better understand heterogeneity in human reasoning in general, and in economic experiments in particular.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 9 Approximate Nonlinear Forecasting Methods ¤ We review key aspects of forecasting using nonlinear models. Because economic models are typically misspecified, the resulting forecasts provide only an approximation to the best possible forecast. Although it is in principle possible to obtain superior approximations to the optimal forecast using nonlinear methods, there are some potentially serious practical challenges. Primary among these are computational difficulties, the dangers of overfit, and potential difficulties of interpretation. In this chapter we discuss these issues in detail. Then we propose and illustrate the use of a new family of methods (QuickNet) that achieves the benefits of using a forecasting model that is nonlinear in the predictors while avoiding or mitigating the other challenges to the use of nonlinear forecasting methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>
Chapter 9. Heterogeneous Agent Modeling: Experimental Evidence ¤ We report on experimental evidence rationalizing the use of heterogeneous agent models. We provide compelling evidence that subjects in laboratory experiments often behave in ways that depart from the rational choice ideal. Further, these subjects' heuristic approaches often differ from one another in distinct, classifiable ways. It follows that models of heterogeneous, boundedly rational agents can often deliver predictions that are a better fit to the experimental data at both the micro- and the macro-levels of analysis than can rational-choice, single-actor models. Our focus in this chapter is on experimental studies developed to address questions in macroeconomics and finance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 26 Principles of Market Adjustment and Stability ¤ First, market prices can exhibit the type of instability predicted by classical dynamic models. Second, the conditions under which instability is observed are not captured by the cobweb model but such conditions are captured by models of the form developed by Marshall and Walras in which the market has perversely shaped curves, such as an upward-sloped demand or downward-sloped supply. Third, the appropriate model, Marshall or Walras, depends on properties of the underlying demand and supply. If the special shape is due to the existence of an externality such as a fad or a Marshallian external economy, then experiments have demonstrated that the Marshallian model is the appropriate model. If the special shape is due to income effects, then the appropriate model is the Walrasian model and not the Marshallian model. That is, if the special shape is due to income effects such as Giffen goods or a backward-bending supply of labor, then the Walrasian model reﬂects the appropriate principles. In summary, the mystery of the price discovery process is solved, in part, by classical models of adjustment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>

Nano-structured diffraction gratings as polarizing beam splitters under vertical incidence ¤ Polarizing beam splitters have numerous applications in optical systems, e.g. for the measurement of freeform surfaces. We present a design and manufacturing process for a nanostructured diffraction grating with optimized diffraction efficiencies for TE- and TM-polarization, which acts as a beam splitter over a long range of incidence angles. First measurements confirm a strong difference in diffraction efficiencies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603135-2>
West Africa: the dynamics and trends of international migration ¤ OECD countries receive a little less than half (97 million in 2000) of the world’s total migrants, of which 3.8 million are from Northern Africa and 1.2 million are from West Africa. West African migration is on the rise, due mainly to an increase in intra-regional mobility (7.5 million). Within the OECD, North America receives the most West African migrants, followed by Europe. This article explores further some current trends in West African migration and outlines some of the issues that could affect this migration in the future, including climate change and demographic concerns in Europe. A European-North African-West African dialogue is proposed to address these future issues and help promote more structured means of cooperation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
The Performance of Financial Groups in the Recent Difficult Environment ¤ The past few years were characterised by an economic downturn, a substantial stock market correction from March 2000 to March 2003, financial asset deterioration, record corporate default rates, the Argentina sovereign default and several natural and man-made catastrophes, including most notably the September 11 attacks. Against this background, the present note looks at the performance of financial groups during this period. The recent decade has seen the formation of an increasing number of such groups, although some have argued that, ex post, the benefits associated with the formation of such groups may have been smaller than initially thought. The note concludes that financial groups have been quite resilient in the face of these various shocks, which is reflected in their equity market valuations...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>

Chapter 2. DSGE Model-Based Forecasting ¤ Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models use modern macroeconomic theory to explain and predict comovements of aggregate time series over the business cycle and to perform policy analysis. We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Households' wealth composition across OECD countries and financial risks borne by households ¤ The first section of this article presents a combined analysis of households’ financial and non-financial balance sheets across OECD countries over the period 1995-2006, based on two OECD data collections – financial balance sheet accounts and households’ financial and non-financial assets. The scope of the study mainly covers households’ gross wealth (financial, dwellings and land) and therefore does not include debt. The second section, based on the OECD households’ financial and non-financial assets database, analyses financial risks borne by households investing their savings either in investment fund shares, in life insurance reserves or in pension schemes, and how these allocations have changed and developed over time in various OECD countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
5. Mechanism Design and Policy Applications ¤ Early in the development of experimental economics interest emerged in using the lab as a test bed for mechanism design and the examination of public policy questions.The contingent valuation method (CVM) is a hypothetical survey instrument that has been widely used and promoted in the assessment of environmental resource damages. Harrison and Rutstrm discuss the crucial issue of whether there is bias in CVM instruments arising from the fact that both the policy being evaluated and its damage prevention value are hypothetical with weak and distorted private incentives for respondents to accurately reveal their preferences. In these settings the question is whether people overstate their true evaluations. They provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of experiments allowing the existence of hypothetical bias to be determined, concluding that the existence of such bias, while highly variable, is persistent and cannot be ignored in the use of CVM instruments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
The Aggregate and Structural Impact of Ageing on Financial Markets : Some Quantitative Assessments ¤ Ageing will translate into long run trends in supply as well as demand of capital in the next decades. This paper provides some quantitative assessments of the effects on financial markets of ageing in four large OECD countries (United States, Japan, Germany, and France). Using a simplified general equilibrium model with overlapping generations, it suggests that ageing could bolster capital-labour ratios and lower interest rates in the future (by 25 bp to 100 bp in the long run, depending on the characteristics of pension systems reforms). In this context, the fear for a future “asset meltdown” due to ageing is probably overstated. The model also suggests that the individual accumulation of capital is likely to increase in the future and require structural changes in financial markets. Households will increasingly need to insure against the uncertainty related to future asset prices, rates of return on capital or individual longevity....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 6. Putting Services and Foreign Direct Investment with Endogenous Productivity Effects in Computable General Equilibrium Models ¤ In this chapter I explain an innovative modeling approach that incorporates services, foreign direct investment (FDI) and endogenous productivity effects from services. I begin with a small stylized model to help understand the fundamental economics. The model shows that services liberalization yields welfare gains several multiples of the welfare gains obtained from a constant to returns to scale model. Further, the welfare gains are supported by the econometric estimates of the gains from trade or FDI liberalization. I then describe computable general equilibrium studies by my colleagues and I conducted for the Russian government on the potential effects of Russian accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). We find that the projected welfare gains generated from liberalization of barriers against foreign direct investment are about 5% of consumption, with the total benefits of all aspects of WTO accession being about 7% of consumption. We find that almost every household in Russia would be expected to gain from WTO accession. We show, however, that a model of Russian WTO accession that fails to incorporate FDI in services and endogenous productivity effects from additional services would yield an estimated gain of less than 1% of consumption with about 7% of the households losing. Reviews of the work have indicated that the work has had a significant influence on the public debate and helped the Russian government to steer public opinion in favor of WTO accession. In the process of doing this work, T. Rutherford and I developed a technique for incorporating tens of thousands of households as agents of the model. All of the major results in the chapter are shown to be robust under sensitivity analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 29 Computational Methods and Models of Politics ¤ In this chapter, we assess recent contributions of computational models to the study of politics. We focus primarily on agent-based models developed by economists and political scientists. These models address collective action problems, questions related to institutional design and performance, issues in international relations, and electoral competition. In our view, complex systems and computational techniques will have a large and growing impact on research on politics in the near future. This optimism follows from the observation that the concepts used in computational methodology in general and agent-based models in particular resonate deeply within political science because of the domains of study in the discipline and because early findings from agent-based models align with widely known empirical regularities in the political world.

Government Debt Management and Bond Markets in Africa ¤ This article presents highlights from the forthcoming OECD cross-country study Public Debt Management and Bond Markets in Africa. Debt managers from an increasing number of emerging market jurisdictions face challenges similar to those of their counterparts from advanced markets due to competitive pressures from global finance and the related need to implement OECD leading practices in this policy area. The article shows that OECD standards in public debt management and related market operations are, therefore, of great importance for public debt management and bond market development in Africa. Several African debt managers have introduced the leading debt management practices of OECD countries, use them for designing new debt strategies (including for managing contingent liabilities), and have made impressive progress in developing their local government securities markets. Many countries in the region are taking advantage of debt reduction initiatives. Avoiding falling back into positions of unsustainable debt is identified as a key challenge for many African governments. OECD financial policy makers are increasingly interested in developments in emerging markets, including those on the African continent. Moreover, emerging markets (including the latest emerging market region, Africa) are an increasingly important asset class for investors from the OECD area. Thus, the policy conclusions and priorities identified here are of interest to not only African countries but also the OECD area and other emerging market countries. Local bond markets in several African countries have gained in strength in terms of liquidity and maturity structure, making them more attractive for important categories of OECD investors and less vulnerable to exchange rate shocks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>

Chapter 16 Property Value Models ¤ One of the only places where environmental quality is traded on explicit markets is real estate. There are several techniques that can be used to study the effects of environmental quality on property values and infer willingness to pay for improvements. The most commonly used method is the hedonic model. In environmental economics the hedonic model has mainly been applied to the prices of real property and to wages. It assumes that there is a schedule of prices for the differentiated product (i.e., houses) that can be estimated. An alternative set of models postulates that consumers' choices are discrete between houses rather than continuous in characteristics as in the hedonic model. Discrete choice models are applied to estimate consumer preferences. Recently a model has been developed that mixes discrete and continuous decisions and emphasizes the locational equilibrium. This chapter reviews these techniques, with an emphasis on methodological issues and recent developments. Section 2 describes the theoretical models that underlie these techniques. The theoretical hedonic model is developed first, and then the theoretical modifications that are necessary for the discrete choice models are described. The main models are developed for residential properties, but differentiated factors of production are discussed briefly. Section 3 is devoted to the empirical issues involved in estimating a hedonic price schedule. This is the most common type of estimation in property value models. Section 4 discusses the empirical application of the second stage of the hedonic model, the estimation of the underlying preferences. Section 5 covers the two types of discrete choice models that are used in environmental economics, random utility models and random bidding models. Section 6 briefly discusses the new locational equilibrium models, and the final section is devoted to conclusions and directions for further research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061616-2>
Chapter 36 Laboratory Tests of Job Search Models ¤ This chapter is concerned with laboratory tests of job search models. Formal models of job search specify certain common elements, i.e., the length of the search horizon, the searcher's discounting rate of interest, the net costs (subsidies) to search in each period of the search horizon, and the searcher's knowledge about the wage offer distribution he or she faces. Because these factors are difficult, if not impossible, to observe in the naturally-occurring economy, controlled laboratory tests of the search model offer the only practical means for formally testing search models. A basic job search model of interest to economists specifies a finite search horizon. Searchers know the (discrete) wage offer distribution and must accept or decline an offer when it is received. The search model has sharp predictions for a utility maximizing, risk neutral agent. In this case the agent seeks to maximize the expected present value of the income from search. This can be accomplished by choosing an appropriate (minimally acceptable) reservation wage each period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 10. Forecasting with Option-Implied Information ¤ This chapter surveys the methods available for extracting information from option prices that can be used in forecasting. We consider option-implied volatilities, skewness, kurtosis, and densities. More generally, we discuss how any forecasting object that is a twice differentiable function of the future realization of the underlying risky asset price can utilize option-implied information in a well-defined manner. Going beyond the univariate option-implied density, we also consider results on option-implied covariance, correlation and beta forecasting, as well as the use of option-implied information in cross-sectional forecasting of equity returns. We discuss how option-implied information can be adjusted for risk premia to remove biases in forecasting regressions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>

Chapter 15 Recreation Demand Models ¤ Travel cost recreation demand models stem from a simple, but penetrating, insight. Consumption of an outdoor recreation site's services requires the user to incur the costs of a trip to that site. Travel costs serve as implicit prices. These costs reflect both people's distances from recreation sites visited and their specific opportunity costs of time. Today, economic analyses of recreation choices are among the most advanced examples of microeconometric modeling of consumer behavior in economics. The primary focus of this chapter is on the methods used to describe individuals' recreation choices. We are interested in the economic assumptions made in descriptions of behavior and measures of the economic value of amenities. Before developing this summary, in Section 2 we discuss how outdoor recreation fits within consumers' overall expenditures. Section 3 describes how we might ideally like to estimate consumers' preferences for recreation resources and the compromises implied by the models currently being used. Econometric details are deferred until Section 5, after a discussion of the features of recreation data in Section 4. In Section 6 we turn to conceptual issues in welfare measurement. We close in Section 7 with a discussion of a few research opportunities that seem especially important for the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061616-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9>
Development of a test environment for the evaluation of human-technology interaction in cockpits of highly-automated vehicles ¤ This paper presents a technologically independent framework to describe test environments suitable for the examination of the driver take-over task present in highly-automated vehicles. As part of a structural analysis, typical influencing factors and parameters defining the driver take-over task are discussed. According to literature, existing studies examining the driver take-over task make use of various test environments. However, the comparability of their results is not given without a detailed understanding of these. Hence, based on established literature, a technologically independent framework has been developed which can be used to describe the distinct test environments. It turned out, that the referenced models had to be partially restructured in order to be suitable for the description of such test environments. The focus of the present paper lies on their technical implementation characterized by stimulus materials, which have been holistically examined for the driver take-over task. Since stimulus materials provide the foundation of a specification of test environments, this work presents an initial step towards a test specification aiming on making results obtained from examinations of the driver take-over task comparable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>
Investing in Infrastructure : Getting the Conditions Right ¤ Maintaining and building new infrastructure that delivers agglomerative benefits is crucial for promoting sustainable economic growth. Capital needs for infrastructure investment are massive. This capital could be sourced especially from pension funds and other institutional investors for whom infrastructure funds are attractive investment vehicles. But in order to mobilise such private capital, the public sector needs to provide the right framework, e.g. by promoting a “Regulated Asset Base” model to improve capital expenditure, by avoiding undue solvency rules and other regulatory obstacles to long-term investment, and by closing the knowledge gap with regard to infrastructure investments. Governments should also avoid crowding out private sector investment, confining interventions to projects where public risk sharing is necessary, and refrain from making frequent short-term changes to the regulatory framework.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 5. Computational Methods for Derivatives with Early Exercise Features ¤ In this paper we consider various computational methods for pricing American style derivatives. We do so under both jump diffusion and stochastic volatility processes. We consider integral transform methods, the method of lines, operator-splitting, and the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the latter being used to generate the benchmark solution. Overall, we find that the method of lines approach is quite competitive with other methods for the problems considered in this paper. As one goes to higher dimensions it may be necessary to use methods such as the sparse grid approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Governance of Banks in China ¤ With the economic reform in the late 1970s, it has been an objective of government policy for Chinese banks to move away from their traditional passive role of executing directives adapted to the active role in resource allocation of banks in a market economy. However, owing to unclear ownership structures and a history of support of regional and industrial policy, most Chinese banks have had difficulty making the transition. This is particularly true for the four large state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). In 1998-99, a significant effort to strengthen SOCB balance sheets was undertaken, but the results were disappointing. In the most recent phase of the reform, which began in 2003, the authorities concluded that >further attempts at rehabilitation of the SOCBs had to address the issue of bank governance......	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Environmentally Responsible Food Choice ¤ The purpose of this paper is to review and assess the role of relevant explanatory variables that influence individual purchase decisions for “environmentally responsible” food consumption. In particular, we provide a detailed review of the key empirical studies in the area of consumer demand for those foods which can be broadly considered as environmentally responsible products (ERPs). We give this definition because the choice of ERPs is a consequence of individual concerns towards environmental and health issues and consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for the environmental and health effects of their food consumption choices. The decision to purchase ERPs should reduce negative environmental effects from intensive agricultural practices, helping to preserve a public good like the environment. Consumption of ERPs should also curb health risks from chemicals for all the household members eating the food purchased in the shops. Therefore, the choice of ERPs reflects both “public” and “private” demands.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
4. Games ¤ This chapter reﬂects attempts to improve upon it and advance our understanding of why it works. The question becomes whether or not the principles of Nash equilibrium can be viewed in the behavior as modification of the attitudes or whether the attitudes themselves induce fundamentally different principles of behavior that can replace the strategic behavior of game theory. The substance of the papers is that strategic behavior is a deep and reliable property of human behavior in conﬂict environments. A sophisticated experienced weighted learning model is compared to reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play across a variety of games. The structure of these models is discussed together with interpretations of the measured parameters and areas of potential improvement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 101 The Endowment Effect ¤ The emergence of empirical evidence suggesting divergence between the willingness- to-accept (WTA), for the sale of an object, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP), for the purchase of an object, has resulted in two explanations. Further they argue that the endowment effect will not apply when the goods are purchased for resale and not for use; there is no endowment effect for the retail firm, only for the consumer purchasing the firm's good. Similarly, they argue that the endowment effect does not apply to the exchange of tokens (or rights) to which private redemption values, or induced values have been assigned by the experimenter. Given the explanations for the divergence between the average WTA and WTP the experimental literature focused on direct choice tests of these (theoretical) explanations, and there examination in market contexts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
