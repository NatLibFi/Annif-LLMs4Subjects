4. Games
This chapter reﬂects attempts to improve upon it and advance our understanding of why it works. The question becomes whether or not the principles of Nash equilibrium can be viewed in the behavior as modification of the attitudes or whether the attitudes themselves induce fundamentally different principles of behavior that can replace the strategic behavior of game theory. The substance of the papers is that strategic behavior is a deep and reliable property of human behavior in conﬂict environments. A sophisticated experienced weighted learning model is compared to reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play across a variety of games. The structure of these models is discussed together with interpretations of the measured parameters and areas of potential improvement.
