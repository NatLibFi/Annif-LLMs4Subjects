Retail Instruments in Public Funding Strategies
Retail borrowing programmes are one component of government debt issuance in both OECD and non-OECD countries. These programmes take a variety of forms and often exist to satisfy a number of objectives. In some jurisdictions, they play a significant funding role. Even in countries where retail borrowing programmes play a small role, they are in many cases politically important because they satisfy primarily social objectives. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to reconsider their retail borrowing programmes. Shrinking borrowing requirements in a number of countries have led to priority being put on maintaining liquid wholesale markets. Other countries continue to see benefits from their retail borrowing programmes and use them as a significant and stable source of funding. These governments are often innovative at finding ways to drive down administration costs, such as through the use of new electronic distribution channels and total dematerialisation of securities.
