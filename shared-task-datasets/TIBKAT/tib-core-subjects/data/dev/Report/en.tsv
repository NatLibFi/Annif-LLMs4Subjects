Bought Time : The Postponed Crisis of Democratic Capitalism ¤ The crisis is holding our breath and at the same time creating a diffuse feeling of helplessness. Following the almost insurmountable problem situations are measures that, like emergency operations on the open heart of the Western world, are performed without knowledge of the patient's history. As serious as the situation is, so little do we seem to understand what exactly is happening. And how it came to be. Wolfgang Streeck presents in his Frankfurt Adorno lecture the roots of the current financial, fiscal, and economic crisis by describing it as a moment of the long neoliberal transformation of post-war capitalism, which began in the 1970s. Following the crisis theories of the time, he analyzes how the tension between democracy and capitalism has unfolded over four decades and what conflicts have resulted from this between states, governments, voters, and capital interests. Finally, he illuminates the transformation of the European state system from the tax to the debt to the consolidation state and asks about the prospects for restoring social and economic stability. Bought Time shows that there is something underlying the current situation that should deeply concern us: the transformation of the relationship between democracy and capitalism. Nominated for the shortlist of the Leipzig Book Prize 2013 in the non-fiction category. “For almost five years, the crisis has been sitting at the dinner table: one family has almost nothing to eat, the other has had to severely restrict itself, and only a few people still see the crisis from the TV. We have become accustomed to unimaginable sums with which private individuals are indebted, state budgets are in the red, and banks must be rescued. The crisis is everyday life. How it came to this, about this the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, born in 1946, has written a furious book. Emerging from three lectures, which the director of the Cologne Max Planck Institute for Social Policy held in Frankfurt in 2012 under the title	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200586-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2>
Knowledge Projects: Collaborative Learning from a Didactic, Software-Technical, and Organizational Perspective ¤ In this book, 22 authors from various disciplines describe theoretical and methodological approaches as well as their practical experiences with collaborative learning in networked contexts. The contributions are framed by their intensive collaboration in the WissPro research project - Knowledge Project "Information Systems in Context". They summarize the didactic, software-technical, and organizational design of university studies as a knowledge project. In knowledge projects, it is about the collaborative construction and transmission of knowledge on a specific topic. In this context, the content-based collaboration is constituted by the different experiences, concerns, and perspectives of the participating individuals and shaped by their continuous engagement with relevant technical systems and organizational structures. Against this conceptual background, the book contributions exemplarily discuss different teaching and learning forms in the computer science study at the universities of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Tübingen and address the content-related subfield that deals with the integration of information systems into development or application contexts. A central role is played by the software products from WissPro: the nationwide used cooperation platform CommSy as well as the Lübeck developments KOIN, CI, and Audis. Three content-related focal points structure the book: "Teaching and Learning in Knowledge Projects" deals with the design of cooperative, project-oriented teaching and learning forms with software support. "Software Design for Knowledge Projects" discusses the development of user-friendly platforms for cooperation support and the construction of knowledge archives in project-oriented teaching and learning forms. "Organization of Knowledge Projects" describes the approach to establishing knowledge projects in university teaching as integrated organizational and software development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116523-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165245-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026896-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
Maya 2008 : 3D Graphics and 3D Animation ; [Modeling, Rendering, Animating ; Textures, Materials, Lighting Effects ; Practice Examples on the CD] ¤ From the house of Autodesk comes the professional 3D visualization and animation software Maya, which is used very strongly in the film and television industry as well as in the creation of graphics for computer games. For the currently current version Maya 2008, the author has rewritten his introductions to the earlier versions Maya 7 (ID 5/06, can expire) and Maya 8/8.5 (ID 22/07, still usable). While the structure of the book is completely the same as that of the predecessor, some changes can be found in the content. The improved integration with Mental Ray's image calculation functions has the strongest impact. The only major new section deals with the use of cameras in Mental Ray. In addition, there are additions in individual chapters. A previously available Personal Learning Edition on CD is only available online (for version 8.5). Example tasks and numerous black-and-white illustrations, whose quality does not always convince, supplement the presentation. Currently the only German-language introduction. In addition to titles on 3ds max and Cinema 4D.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7610951-3>
Alexander von Humboldt and Globalization : the Mobile of Knowledge ¤ The author, a professor of Romance literature in Potsdam, is a renowned Humboldt researcher. With this book, he presents the world-renowned naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) as a thinking world citizen who connects, as a scientist who combines mobility and science in his work in a genius way and thus has already internalized the idea of globalization in his self-understanding as a researcher. For this image, Ette draws a context in which he shows that one can understand globalization not only as a unique phenomenon of our modern time, but as a longer-lasting process with various "acceleration phases". As further characteristics of Humboldt's thinking and scientific work, the author cites his "intellectual honesty" as well as Humboldt's consideration of errors or failed projects as a productive source of knowledge. A demanding work primarily oriented towards the thinker Humboldt without visual material. Well imaginable next to Humboldt biographies like that of T. Richter (BA 7/09).

Market Growth Scenarios for Electric Vehicles: Review and Outlook until 2030 ¤ The dissemination of electric vehicles plays an important role in achieving climate goals in the transport sector and can also contribute to greater energy supply independence. The exploration of their dissemination is therefore still of great relevance. In the framework of a study for the National Platform Electromobility (NPE), market growth scenarios for electric vehicles were developed until 2020 in 2013. Almost ten years later, this working paper compares the former methodology and results with real developments. In addition, methodological innovations are explained and a look at model results for the year 2030 is taken, in order to examine the new politically set target achievement of 15 million pure electric vehicles and the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. It shows that many developments were well estimated and that due to low fuel prices, no significant market penetration of electric vehicles could be seen for a long time. With numerous political support measures and EU regulation on fleet limits, Germany was at the end of 2020, however, in the middle of the 2013 established result range. For 2030, target achievement is also largely dependent on the level of fleet limits and ambitious intermediate steps in GHG emission reduction. Only then can 15 million pure electric vehicles be reached in 2030.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037630-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7>
Fire Alarm Systems : Planning, Installation, Operation ¤ Fire protection is an important topic and yet there is little (practical) literature on the subject. The author - an expert in this field (employee in VDE working groups, expert etc.) - summarizes here the most important information: the difficult to overview regulations, standards, regulations etc., guidelines for planning and project planning as well as for the selection of the right devices etc. There were many innovations; a new edition was therefore necessary. It should - as far as possible (since relatively expensive) - be acquired (previous editions may be exchanged), as it not only addresses professionals in planning and project planning (craftsmen, engineers, and those in training) but can also serve the layman who wants to inform himself about the optimal devices for his private house. (2) (LK/W: Weinheimer-Hartmann) The author is a fire protection expert and summarizes here the most important information: regulations, standards, regulations, guidelines for planning and project planning as well as for the selection of the right devices etc. Interesting for both professionals in planning and project planning as well as for laymen.

Applied Microbiology : with 69 Tables ¤ This textbook of "Applied Microbiology" by G. Antranikian, Professor of Microbiology at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg and recipient of the German Environmental Prize 2004, compiled for the first time, reveals to us this interdisciplinary and innovative cross-sectional science. Biologists, chemists, engineers, and bioinformaticians inform about their respective research focuses within applied microbiology. The annual growth rate of microbial products, such as chemicals, vitamins, biopolymers, and fuels, is between 10 and 20 percent. Applied microbiology is thus one of the most promising research areas of the 21st century. Highly recommended. So far, nothing comparable on the market.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130323-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026845-7>
Southern Germany from the Earth's Middle Ages to the Present ¤ Southern Germany belongs to the most diverse landscapes on earth. Hardly any other region offers on such a small area a comparable variety of natural environments: mountain and plateaus landscapes, the massive fault zone of the Upper Rhine Graben and alpine high mountain regions are just as found as landscapes shaped by volcanism, glaciers and meteorite impacts. Southern Germany experienced in the last 140 million years tropical, subtropical and arctic climate phases, whose traces are still recognizable in parts of the landscape today. The authors present the landscape history of southern Germany in a generally understandable way for a broad readership. They design a virtual image of southern Germany for each time phase. Comparisons - and four-coloured photos - with modern landscapes outside Europe enable the reader to develop a better understanding of the former appearance of southern Germany. In excursions, interesting regional information is conveyed and also methods on how one arrives at the presented findings. In the present 2nd edition, a detailed look at the future of the southern German landscape is thrown. The elaborately designed non-fiction book, with numerous four-coloured graphics, detailed block images and illustrative photos, wants to contribute to a better understanding of our current living and economic space. The ecological and economic potential of southern Germany cannot be explained without considering the landscape history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034343-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020216-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034348-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020227-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025104-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075273-2>
Design Concept ¤ Foundational series for first-year architecture and civil engineering students, externally reminiscent of study scripts and offering a clear introduction to the subject (most recently in BA 8/07: J. Krebs: CAD; L. Steiger: Wood construction; A. Meistermann: Structural systems). The present title describes the entry point into the creative process of design: the search for an idea at the beginning of a design. Fundamentals of design in the landscape, urban planning, and social context are conveyed, as well as design and building function, shape finding, engagement with material and construction, and general creativity techniques. Typically equipped with small-format black-and-white photos, numerous practical tips, and further literature references. Recommended as an introductory reading for the target group before the standard work by E. Neufert: "Design Theory" (most recently ID 52/05) and the specialist book by C. Gänshirt: "Tools for Ideas" (ID 32/07). A ekz-folio binding is recommended. (2) END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004744-1>

Adaptive windows for duplicate detection ¤ Duplicate detection describes the finding of multiple data sets that represent the same real-world object. This task is not trivial, as (i) the data sets can differ slightly, requiring similarity measures for a pairwise comparison, and (ii) due to the data volume, a complete, pairwise comparison is not possible. To solve the second problem, various algorithms exist that partition the data volume and perform comparisons only within the partitions. One of these algorithms is the Sorted-Neighborhood Method (SNM), which sorts the data according to a key and then slides a window over the sorted data. Comparisons are only performed within this window. We describe various variations of the Sorted-Neighborhood Method, which are based on varying window sizes. These approaches are based on the intuition that areas with greater and lesser similarities exist within the sorted data sets, for which correspondingly larger and smaller window sizes are meaningful. We describe and evaluate various adaptation strategies, some of which have been proven to be more efficient than the original Sorted-Neighborhood Method (same result with fewer comparisons).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191565-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078821-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193434-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4328500-4>
The influence of large offshore wind farms on the North Sea and Baltic Sea - a comprehensive literature review ¤ This literature review summarizes research on the environmental impacts of offshore wind farms, identifies gaps in current knowledge related to offshore wind energy, and makes recommendations for future research. The offshore wind energy industry in Europe is expected to grow rapidly: in the European Union, 69 wind farms in 11 countries have a combined capacity greater than 6.5 gigawatts (GW), and some projections predict a capacity of 40 GW by the year 2020. Despite expectations for the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms, little research has studied the effects of offshore wind farms on oceanography. Most research has focused on biotic effects including noise, bird collisions, mammalian avoidance, and the artificial reef effect. The following review will hypothesize the largest potential wind farm-induced impacts to oceanography and consequences that could result from changes to oceanography. Oceanographic processes that could be affected by offshore wind farms are downstream turbulence, surface wave energy, local scour, inflowing currents, and surface upwelling. Existing research predicts that most wind farm-induced changes will be within the wind farm footprint or within natural variations. Some studies hypothesize that “extreme” scenarios could cause irreversible changes to shoreline deposition, upwelling patterns, or bottom oxygen levels, but this review found no research that quantified these changes with confidence. Potential connections exist between offshore wind farms, the alteration of oceanographic processes and changes to local sediment, nutrient, or phytoplankton regimes, but these connections have not been studied and are only speculative. Current numerical modeling research does little to predict the effects of large-scale construction, potential cumulative effects of multiple farms, or far-field effects at the coast. This review therefore recommends that future numerical models focus on wind farms with hundreds of turbines, the interactions of multiple wind farms, and downstream changes due to wind farms. Observational studies are also necessary to validate the models, and extensive site-specific data collection is necessary to compare any changes to the natural ocean state. The conclusions and recommendations from this review will be used to inform research related to the Coastal Observation System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, which uses data from a marine observation network in the North Sea to validate and improve coastal modeling results. One core question that COSYNA seeks to address is how the offshore wind farms will locally and remotely affect the physical dynamics, sediment transport, and biological processes in the North Sea. The gaps in research and potentially relevant offshore wind farm impacts as identified by this review will guide future COSYNA projects including data collection, model development, and research cruise campaigns.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124348-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4543294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125537-9>

Mathematics for Computer Scientists : Algebra, Analysis, Discrete Structures ¤ Introductions to mathematics for computer scientists include, among others, W. Struckmann (ID 2/07) and D. Hachenberger (ID 29/05). The present book is aimed at computer science students in their early semesters. Each chapter begins with concrete, familiar terms and situations and then abstracts to the terms of modern mathematics. The book is similar to D. Hachenberger, who wants to consolidate mathematical school knowledge and then present this knowledge in a significantly more abstract and formal form. The book is divided into the parts Algebra, Analysis, and discrete structures (including foundations of mathematics). The individual parts can be studied independently of each other. Challenging tasks are provided for each chapter (with short solution sketches in the appendix). The book is thus also well suited for self-study. Emphasis is placed on applications that have a close relationship to computer science, for example, the functioning of spam filters, the management of large data sets with hash tables, or the efficient retrieval of information with search engines.

Sustainable Land Management in Northern Lowlands ¤ Climate change and the globalization of markets increasingly influence our society. A future-proof, sustainable land management must take account of these developments. It must reorient itself and design its goals and measures in such a way that it can respond flexibly to changing framework conditions. In the joint project „NaLaMa-nT“, the conditions were analyzed for the Northern Lowlands in the model regions of Diepholz, Uelzen, Fläming and Oder-Spree, and model-supported developments were assessed, adaptation needs in agriculture, forestry and water management were shown, and transsectoral criteria and indicators of sustainable land management were identified. The results provide decision-making aids to balance potential conflicts of interest and initiate adaptation measures and a transsectoral sustainability monitoring. They create reliable bases for spatial planning and decisions in companies, administrations, and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007394-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259046-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017966-7>

Thermoplastic, Roll-Formed Profiles in Hybrid Construction 2 - TroPHy2 : Research Reports from the Research Campus Open Hybrid LabFactory ¤ The book presents the final report of the TroPHy2 consortium project. In the project, a hybrid roll-forming machine was developed, with which hybrid components made of metal profiles and carbon fibers with a thermoplastic matrix can be produced. This machine was set up in the Open Hybrid LabFactory's workshop in Wolfsburg. The partners investigated and validated the necessary manufacturing processes. The goal was to develop a structurally optimized, hybrid automotive component that represents the weight-saving potential of hybrid materials. A weight saving of up to 44.9% was calculated, significantly exceeding the 25% weight saving target set at the beginning of the project. The lightweight potential of the hybrid material was thus clearly demonstrated. The editor, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Martin Wiedemann, studied aerospace engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. He then researched in various institutes of the university in the field of aerospace and graduated in 1991. Subsequently, he was active in various leading positions at EADS Airbus GmbH. Between 2005 and 2007, he was responsible as chief engineer in the A400M program for the fuselage and control surfaces. Since 2007, he has been directing the DLR Institute for Fiber Composite Lightweight Construction and Adaptronics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133452-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175096-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056863-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279743-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165100-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205895-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4340650-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159653-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136513-6>

Lehmbau Regeln : Terms - Building Materials - Building Components ¤ The 3rd, revised edition of the Lehmbau Regeln, published by the Dachverband - Lehm e.V. on the occasion of the 5th International Conference on Earth Construction (LEHM 2008), takes into account the current state of development of earth construction since its first appearance 10 years ago. This edition has also been included in the model list of the Technical Building Regulations of the German Institute for Building Technology Berlin and has been recommended to the federal states for official introduction. This has already been done in most federal states. The revision of the Lehmbau Regeln was again supported by the German Federal Foundation for the Environment. - - The Lehmbau Regeln describe the requirements for building earth and define the properties for the usability of earth building materials, including the required tests. For the most important applications, including load-bearing walls, guidelines for proper execution and construction are given. A chapter on material and component values closes the Lehmbau Regeln in terms of content. - - The Lehmbau Regeln are primarily aimed at architects and civil engineers as well as students of these disciplines, at crafts businesses and construction companies as well as at authorities and experts. - - The publisher of the Lehmbau Regeln is the Dachverband Lehm e.V., the Federal Association for the Promotion of Earth Construction. Founded in 1992, it now comprises more than 220 members from a circle of interested experts, particularly crafts businesses, architects and civil engineers, building material manufacturers, representatives of institutions, environmentally oriented associations.

Elementary Number Theory ¤ ... the authors begin with the prime factorization and the greatest common divisor - two concepts that are well known from school education, but lose much of their self-evidence with closer examination. They also discuss the theoretical background of the decimal system familiar from everyday life, congruence calculations, primitive roots, and the reciprocity law for quadratic residues. Their book (2nd edition: ID 44/95, ed. Red.) is aimed at lecturers and students of mathematics, teachers at real schools and gyms, as well as all those interested in a branch of mathematics that is over three thousand years old. It assumes no knowledge beyond elementary school material. Due to its thoroughness, it can be used both as a lecture companion and for self-study. Exercises at the end of each paragraph help to practice and deepen the treated material. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294368-1>
Cross-Functional Project Management : Foundations of Successful Projects ¤ Project management has become an increasing challenge in times of shrinking project budgets and project schedules. The authors provide valuable assistance in crisis situations and show how a consistent line is brought into a project from the outset. Furthermore, the various interfaces to the different disciplines in software engineering are shown. Another focus of the book is the concrete use of a tool that steers the entire process from the project leader's point of view. Further topics are reporting, crisis management, risk management, and personnel management within complex projects	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116521-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047441-0>
Regional Garden Culture : On the Identity of Landscapes ¤ The German Society for Garden Art and Landscape Culture e.V. (DGGL) presents its first annual book. - Cities discover their surroundings. Historical gardens and parks, but also the landscape that has developed over many decades, take center stage in concepts and strategies for the region. The Regional Park RheinMain, the Garden-Landscape Ostwestfalen-Lippe, and the Garden Dreams of Saxony-Anhalt are just a few examples that the German Society for Garden Art and Landscape Culture addresses in its annual book. While some regions can draw on a rich heritage of well-known and lesser-known parks, others, such as the Saar region or Lusatia, face major challenges in the face of decades-long exploitation of the landscape for coal mining. The book shows how the identity of these landscapes is worked out and strengthened with which strategies and provides a comprehensive overview of current concepts for cultural landscape in Germany.

The Big Computer Book for Dummies : [Windows Vista, Internet, Google Search, Music, Film, Photos, E-Mail, Word 2007, Excel 2007] ¤ To the appearance (TopTen-Lists, hint icons, readable screenshots etc.), loose, understandable writing style and information density with numerous step-by-step instructions of the well-known "Dummies" series, not much more needs to be said. The present computer book contains 7 thematic complexes, to which already other "Dummies" titles exist, where only in one chapter direct overlaps to Dan Gookin: "PCs for Dummies" (last BA 5/08) are detectable. Treated are the construction and function of PCs, knowledge about Windows Vista (cf. A. Rathbone: last BA 9/07), music, films, photos with the PC manage and play, e-mail use and internet (cf. R. Levine: last BA 5/08), internet research with Google, basics of Office 2007, Word 2007 and Excel 2007 (cf. P. Weverka: BA 11/07). Through the compact information and the strongly structured table of contents also suitable for looking up. The current all-round overview of the most common questions for PC beginners can be recommended for every library size, also in addition to the more comprehensive single titles.

Bicycles : Types and Technology, Fitness and Leisure, Training and Tours ¤ Image-text volume with tips on technique, riding technique, fitness. Mainly for sport-oriented cyclists. (Rolf Raschka) The author deals with cycling with the family, behavior in city traffic and on tours (cf. e.g. Gunnar Fehlau: "Cycling Tours," BA 9/03) but mainly addresses drivers who develop ambition beyond everyday use. This begins with technology, as a section on the touring bike is followed by many portraits of racing machines and mountain bikes of all kinds. In addition, there are plenty of tips on sports riding technique, nutrition, and fitness. The approximately 45-page, image-oriented section on maintenance work is partially useful for all wheels, partially only for special machines (brief repair manual lastly Richard Hallett: BA 8/03). Little attention is paid to the further very widespread derailleur gears. Overall, an somewhat unbalanced representation, whose Anglo-Saxon origin is noticeable. Considering the very attractive equipment with many small and large color photos, it will achieve good loan numbers. The price is reasonable for the offered. In the appendix, Fachlexikon and Register.

The Downfall of the Habsburg Monarchy ¤ Not through a chronologically continuous presentation but a grouping by thematic fields, the author allows for a "glimpse into the depth" of the complex relationships. He "brushes history against the grain" and opens up new perspectives on facts that are already known. Review: The Austrian historian has established himself as an expert on the subject in numerous publications (e.g. "The First World War", 2011; "Habsburg's dirty war"; 2014). He "brushes history against the grain". In doing so, he does not proceed in a chronologically developing manner, but forms thematic blocks such as "The persistence of fragility", "Solutions through violence", "Anatomy of collapse", "The legacy" etc. With this, he wants to direct the view "from the surface to the depth" up to the voices of eyewitnesses. He hopes to avoid the danger of simplifying complex relationships. The question repeatedly asked in the abundant specialized literature on the 1st World War, whether the Habsburg monarchy was doomed to collapse, or as a state entity had chances of survival, he cannot and does not want to answer conclusively. The book offers something like "alternative historiography" and enables a new perspective on known facts. In this sense, an important and recommended addition to existing relevant titles.

Integrated Educational Support : Flexibility, Integration and Community Reference in Youth Welfare ¤ Integration, community reference and flexibility are currently in vogue in social work. However, it is not always clear what is meant by this. Are integrated flexible aids an additional offer in the context of the differentiated youth welfare system, or do the frequently used terms flexible aids and integrated aids in everyday life and practice refer to a new quality structure? The answer given in this volume, based on the INTEGRA project of the International Society for Educational Support, is clear. It is about a new quality structure of educational support, about the redesign of a needs-oriented and flexible, regionalized youth welfare and at the same time about an alternative, cooperative control and modernization strategy compared to the current mainstream. The implementation of integrated and flexible educational support addresses some central contradictions of youth welfare and brings them to a new balance. In addition, it expands youth welfare towards community orientation with an important action maxim. In the first part of the volume, the position of integrated, flexible and community-oriented educational support is presented, while in the second part, the results of the model project are presented, both in terms of the perspectives of those affected (children, young people and their parents as well as employees) and the problems of switching and implementation, which are in the foreground.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115645-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113843-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4587343-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116546-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177425-5>
Quantum Physics for Dummies : [not for dilettantes, quantum physics; at a glance: complex expressions understand - from eigenvalue to oscillator; the latest research results; prepare successfully for exams; with exercises also solve difficult equations] ¤ S. Holzner is an award-winning author of physical and technical books (lastly BA 12/09) and was active as a professor at an American university for several years. He presents here an introduction to quantum physics, which is primarily aimed at students, but can also be used with benefit by participants in advanced high school courses. However, it is stated on the cover: "Not for dilettantes, quantum physics." It is assumed that thorough knowledge of differential and integral calculus is required. In addition, one learns to handle matrices and vectors as needed. Topics include, among others, particle energy levels, potential wells, harmonic oscillators, angular momentum and spin, the Schrödinger equation, and many-particle systems. The "Top-Ten-Section" at the end includes ten web pages on quantum physics and further information on "Ten Highlights of Quantum Physics". Symbols point, among other things, to important equations and knowledge for experts. Notably, the constant effort to provide a good didactic presentation is to be emphasized.

A Little Night Physics: Stories from Physics ¤ This is not a strictly chronologically constructed history of physics, but a collection of well-readable episodes from the lives of physicists from various epochs. The author has understood how to present the otherwise mostly abstractly concerned scientists from their entirely human side in a generally understandable language, without losing themselves in mere chatter. The 35 chapters in total are thematically mostly ordered according to physical matters and biographically thus touch on several physicists each. Among the more than 200 named individuals, Aristotle, Bohr, Einstein, Feynman, Galilei, Heisenberg, Helmholtz, Maxwell, Newton, Pauli, Planck, Plato, Rutherford, Schrödinger, Sommerfeld, and Weizsäcker are mentioned most frequently. In style and structure, it is not directly comparable to similar titles. A little more illustrations would have done the otherwise very successful book good. Almost 100 sources of literature encourage a deeper engagement with the subject. Recommended for physicists, natural scientists, and interested laypeople. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1>
New Spaces of Water Management : Investigations on Drinking Water Supply and Sewage Disposal in the Regions of Munich, Hanover and Frankfurt (Oder) ¤ The starting point of the investigations was the assumption that the three case regions are affected by the same overarching water management developments: Europeanization, regionalization of economic relationships, differentiation of consumption patterns, the emergence of new technical options, and commercialization, but otherwise exhibit different framework conditions. The case studies are similarly structured: After a brief description of the socio-economic development of the region, the structure and current changes in the regional water management are presented, followed by a more in-depth examination of the spatial "key issue". In the concluding Chapter 4, a comprehensive and comparative consideration of the case study results is carried out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000306-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193371-0>
Healthier living - Harmonious living: Room inspirations for well-being ¤ How trees are to be designed so that they meet the demands of harmonious and healthy living is illustrated in this informative text-image book with practical examples. Much greenery, proper light, suitable colors, calming water and scents, as well as the best traditions of Eastern and Western housing traditions are combined here. Installations that promote harmony and relaxation, ideas for revitalizing rooms and avoiding allergenic substances are shown. Considering health holistically, it is an important concern of the author, and aspects of environmental and resource protection are also highlighted. No specific style of living is in the foreground, the theme is transferable to different types of apartments. In times of the well-being and wellness wave, this book will certainly find a lot of support. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020754-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066761-3>
Mathematics for Engineers : an Intuitive Introduction for Practical Studies ; with 141 Exercise Problems and Solutions ; [with Bridge Course for Beginners on CD-ROM] ¤ Publisher's text: "Mathematics in a Relaxed Atmosphere" is the guiding principle of this easily understandable textbook. In a narrative style and with many examples, the author not only illuminates higher mathematics, but also places the subject matter in relation to its applications. The entire mathematics important for the engineering student is treated in one volume. This is achieved by forgoing abstract heights and through a test-adequate subject selection that strictly aligns with the needs of the future engineer. The book can be used accompanying lectures or for self-study. The 141 exercise problems with solutions support the practice of the subject matter and are extensively worked out in the volume "Exercise Problems for Mathematics for Engineers". The "Bridge Course" on the accompanying CD-ROM facilitates the entry of beginners	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9>
Microsoft Office Excel 2003 : compact, complete, competent ¤ This is apparently the successor to the "Magnum" guide to Excel 2002 by Günter Born (not discussed here). The present work is thematically built differently, but as the comparison of the commented overall brief overview "Quickview" shows, the new version also contains all relevant information for working with the spreadsheet program, from start and basic operation to table technology, design, reports and graphical presentation up to special techniques and macro- or VBA programming. As usual, everything is presented in a clear and understandable way, with many exemplary screenshots and enhanced by numerous useful additional notes. Although the book must not be purchased only because of the few innovations in version 2003 - Schels quoted in the appendix: "The software feature wars are over" - but if you want to offer another good, comprehensive handbook by an experienced author (lastly BA 3/04, see his almost simultaneously published, somewhat differently arranged, bound and expensive "Compendium"), you are right here.

Foundations for Climate Change-Adaptive Urban and Open Space Planning : Wolfgang Wende, Stefanie Rößler, Tobias Krüger (Eds.) ¤ The consequences of climate change are particularly noticeable in the settlement areas. Volume 6 of the REGKLAM publication series summarizes the project's work on the foundations of climate-resilient settlement development. In addition to methods, concrete research results are presented that are directly related to the bioclimatic effects of urban building and vegetation structures. Approaches for climate-resilient urban and open space planning are formulated. The thematic spectrum includes the identification of heat-sensitive settlement areas, the evaluation of thermal loads in various urban planning situations, as well as methods for capturing the green infrastructure of settlement areas as a basis for evaluating the climatic performance and the effects of planning decisions. Furthermore, open space planning options for vacant land are presented under the aspect of their suitability for climate adaptation, as well as suitability recommendations for the use of urban trees.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034354-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>
Mythos Germania : Vision and Crime ¤ The book accompanying the exhibition of the 'Berliner Unterwelten e.V.' offers a richly illustrated and multifaceted insight into the gigantic plans of the NS-State, connected with the name Albert Speer, for the transformation of Berlin into the 'World Capital Germania'. Review: The book, available in 2nd, updated edition (1st edition 2014), accompanies the exhibition of the 'Berliner Unterwelten e.V.' With excellent printed, partly colored illustrations, it offers a multifaceted insight into the plans of the NS-State for the re-shaping of Berlin, mainly connected with the name Albert Speer (cf. G. Sereny: 1995). Short expert articles and expert interviews illuminate the background of the 'World Capital Germania' from an interdisciplinary perspective, taking into account historical, architectural, urban planning, and sociological aspects. Exemplary building projects, such as the 'Soldiers' Hall', are presented, as well as existing NS-buildings in Berlin. Finds like models, drawings, caricatures, photographs, etc. shed further light on the gigantic building project. Vivid design in text and image, good readability, high information content, making it suitable for a broader audience interested in contemporary history. Index is missing, references are only provided for some contributions. (2-3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013021-6>
Descriptive Statistics : practice-oriented introduction ; with tasks and solutions ¤ Introduction to descriptive statistics with many examples for students of business administration and practitioners who want to work on the material in self-study. (LK/GÖ: Vetter) With many examples in the text, an introduction for students of business administration that is also suitable for practitioners who want to work on the material in self-study (9th edition cf. ID-B 20/11). For the 11th edition, the text was reviewed and revised again according to the preface, but practically there have been hardly any changes since the 4th edition (2001). Each section ends with tasks and test questions. The title can still be recommended as a general introduction to the topic. Older than the 4th edition should be replaced, younger editions can be outdated. (2) (LK/GÖ: Vetter)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070313-7>
Forest Growth Knowledge-Based Software Systems on the Basis of TreeGrOSS - Application and Theoretical Foundations ¤ Against the backdrop of changing framework conditions and increasing demands on a multifunctional forestry, decision-making for forest managers is becoming increasingly complex. Computer-based forest decision support systems provide assistance in solving complex planning tasks and can be adapted to changed framework conditions and questions. At the Northwest German Forest Research Institute, three decision support systems were implemented for different fields of application and target groups, which are continuously updated and further developed: the ForestSimulator, the Forest Planner, and the Web Business Planner. All three systems are based on the forest growth library TreeGrOSS. (Tree Growth Open Source Software). In this volume, the functions and operation of the three systems are described first, and then the models and methods used are extensively documented and explained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155059-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6>
Operating Systems: A Compact Introduction with Linux ¤ The present textbook provides a comprehensive and multi-faceted introduction to the concepts and functions of modern operating systems. The fundamental mechanisms of an operating system are analyzed and illustrated by means of concrete listings of the Linux kernel. The complexity of an operating system and the impressive ingenuity of the underlying algorithms and their skilled implementation in C code are at the center of the book. The reader thus obtains a solid understanding of the system architecture and its concrete realization. The text is suitable for basic studies from the third semester and assumes in addition to basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures a solid understanding of C programming.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006216-8>

The Energy Trap: A Look Back at the Oil Age ¤ The question is not whether fossil energy carriers (especially oil) will eventually run out, but how soon the sources will finally be exhausted. 3 years after his notable debut "Öko-Realismus" (BA 2/03), which Gründinger (born 1984) had presented as a high school student, the student of political science and member of Youth for Intergenerational Justice and Sustainability - Europe (YOIS) deals extensively with the pressing energy question. The "pyromaniac" humanity is burning itself, having become trapped in a threatening trap through its dependence on the "black drug oil", from which it can hardly escape. His requiem for fossil-atomic energy supply, critical analysis of the current energy system, and his advocated "Path to an Industrial Solar Age" (Energy Revolution) are based on a broad fund of current data and facts from specialist literature, but also on hidden documents. With bibliography. Like H. Scheer: "Energy Autonomy" (BA 10/05) an important, competent contribution to the topic, this time from the younger generation. Highly recommended.

The federal government and the states provide financial aid for investments in the renewal and development of cities and municipalities within various programs to strengthen them as economic and residential locations. Since 1971, more than 5,000 measures have been promoted in over 2,000 municipalities with around 120 billion euros in federal funds alone. In addition, there are co-financing funds from the states and municipalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313253-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056769-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
The Clear Line : Kitzmann Architects Hamburg ¤ Publisher's information: Urban contemporary architecture is often so heavily influenced by the Zeitgeist that the results appear arbitrary and placeless. By avoiding fashionable and grand gestures from the outset and focusing on the essential form, the function of the house, and its precise integration into the urban landscape, a technically and aesthetically durable outcome is achieved through the deliberate reduction of style elements, materials, and colors. This claim defines the self-awareness of Kitzmann Architects. The spectrum of works created over 25 years, presented in the richly illustrated book, ranges from furniture design to large office buildings in the city center, from row houses to comprehensive schools. They all are committed to the enlightened spirit of modernity and translate its program into the present - down to the smallest detail.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
The Secret of Transcendental Numbers: A Somewhat Different Introduction to Mathematics ¤ More than 2,000 years lie between the point in time when the task of squaring a circle with compass and straightedge was formulated and the negative solution in the 19th century, namely the proof that the circle number is not a zero of a rational polynomial, thus transcendental. Exactly this way, in modern form, is followed by the author here. Almost in a conversational tone, yet always exactly and without gaps, he leads the reader from the introduction of number systems through the required areas of algebra and analysis to the solution, a project-oriented introduction to wide areas of theoretical mathematics. He always takes the time for methodical considerations, cross-references, and also anecdotal color splashes. The reader feels included in the struggle for the right way to the goal. It is consistent that at the end, in addition to the latest results, open questions also stand. The substantial, almost unparalleled work in the German-language specialist literature can be recommended with great emphasis to connoisseurs who will still find much more original, and to beginners as an introduction. (2 S) (Wolfgang Grölz) A project-oriented comprehensive introduction that leads from the beginnings of the concept of numbers through all important areas of theoretical mathematics to the proof of the transcendence of the circle number and thus the impossibility of a constructive squaring of the circle.

Linux Mint 18 : Practical Knowledge for New and Switching Users ¤ Linux Mint is a Linux distribution based on Linux Ubuntu that is very well suited for switchers from Windows. The present book by Troche is dedicated to the version Linux Mint 18 (Sarah) which is also included on CD-ROM. The author focuses on switchers from Windows. He begins with a note on who Linux is not suitable for (large games) and then presents the different versions of Linux Mint with their possibilities. Further focuses lie then on various installations (e.g. parallel operation of Linux Mint and Windows), on security issues, on the office software LibreOffice and on Linux Mint in the cloud.

Municipal Survey: Migration, Housing, Neighborhood : Report within the Research Project "Coherence Needs Spaces - Integrative Housing with Migrants" ¤ In the nationwide research project "Coherence Needs Spaces - Integrative Housing with Migrants", within the framework of which the present publication was created, the housing supply and social spatial integration of newly arrived, particularly refugee people are examined. Equally, the municipal status quo is recorded and municipal action spaces are explored. The project's occasion was the observation that in isolated municipalities, housing projects are emerging that are characterized by an integrative approach, creating spaces for the coexistence of different social groups with (new) migrants. How widespread these are and what other approaches and measures municipalities take for the accommodation, housing supply, and integration of newly arrived and refugee people are recorded in the municipal survey. In particular, the contents of the survey focused on (see questionnaire in the appendix): (1) the accommodation and housing situations of newly arrived/refugees in the municipalities, including the dissemination of integrative housing projects, (2) coexistence and integration in neighborhoods, (3) measures that promote coexistence and integration in districts, (4) plans and conceptual approaches to improve housing supply. This also included the economically relevant question of creating long-term affordable housing (not only) for refugees.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187014-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117672-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077570-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066757-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124224-5>
The Hour of the Fools : How We Are Destroying Our Culture on the Internet ¤ The Internet, especially Web 2.0, is a blessing for freedom of opinion, so they say: Finally, everyone can decide what is being discussed - not just experts, top journalists, and eloquent authors who claim the monopoly of opinion for themselves. But what have we gotten ourselves into? Forum contributions that are bursting with stupidity and false facts, and YouTube videos that are hardly outdone in idiocy. It gets even worse: political splinter parties and eccentric crackpots are increasingly masquerading as harmless bloggers to spread anti-democratic hate campaigns. Those affected can hardly defend themselves. Companies are practicing subtle "viral marketing" to have their products recommended by supposedly enthusiastic customers. Clever lobbyists are mixing in with false identities in discussions to push through their questionable interests. We are on a dangerous path, says Andrew Keen: Where half-knowledge and bare lies reign instead of reliable information, there is also a lack of a basis for reasonable and sustainable political decisions, there our culture is shaken to its foundations. A sharply formulated plea against the absurd excesses of the great dumbing-down machine that calls itself the Internet. Keen, who himself is a "product" of Silicon Valley and mutated into the sharpest critic of Web 2.0, mainly highlights two consequences of the participatory Internet: cultural flattening and the economic consequences of massive intellectual theft. Blogs in three-digit millions, Wikipedia, YouTube, and other platforms for user-generated content are at the center of the analysis. Discussion book, also especially for librarians.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227561-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548364-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616549-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156464-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114011-4>
The Beginner's Seminar on Object-Oriented Programming in Java ¤ Proven introduction to Java and the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming for beginners, which now takes into account Java 7 (latest edition: 4th edition, BA 12/04; can be used, sort out older ones). Explains the principle of object orientation in creating first programs under Java in a concise but sufficiently detailed manner. Proceeds very practically using realistic example applications (e.g. programming a loan program for a school library), where theoretical sections are supplemented by examples and exercises in a meaningful way (solution part at the end of the book). Can be used well in conjunction with the Java exercise book by the same author (BA 5/09). For a broader user group than H. Balzert (BA 5/10) or M. Block (BA 4/10), who mainly focus on computer scientists in the first semester.

Microbiology: The Discovery of the Invisible World ¤ The book describes important and pioneering historical milestones of microbiology up to the present. It also conveys basic knowledge about biochemistry, molecular biology, and the genetics of microorganisms as well as their importance in the natural household. (Helmut Köhne) The book describes important and pioneering historical milestones of microbiology up to the present. They are presented in close connection with the biography and major research achievements of significant scientists such as Leeuwenhoeck, Robert Koch, Ferdinant Kohn, or Paul Ehrlich, who have advanced microbiological research decisively through the development of microscopes, the introduction of more effective laboratory methods, the discovery of pathogens, or the detection of important bacterial metabolic cycles. Basic knowledge is also conveyed about biochemistry, molecular biology, and the genetics of microorganisms as well as their great importance in the natural household. The book, which is understandable with general biological knowledge, covers a central theme spectrum, but it is not a systematically conceived textbook of microbiology.

Global culture : media, arts, policy, and globalization ¤ For McDonalds, MTV & Co. there is no terra incognita anymore, as these signs of cultural globalization have already penetrated into the last corners of the world. The contributions of the volume investigate how and with what success states, cities, as well as public and private cultural organizations try to intervene in the processes of cultural globalization. In the first part, differences and similarities between the cultural policies in Europe, the United States, and Asia are asked. Thus, the cultural policy of France, Sweden, and the United States is compared under the aspect of the relationship between private and public cultural funding, and the development of Japanese cultural policy and the orientation towards Western models is presented. The second part is dedicated to the regeneration of depleted cultural resources in cities that had suffered economic losses. Thus, the effect of a cultural and economic upswing through the establishment of new museums in cities such as Liverpool, Marseille, and Barcelona is investigated. Another contribution analyzes the positive effect of globalization on local music traditions, as can be seen in Brazil, for example. The third part shows, using the examples of Singapore and Ferrara, how cultural policy can contribute to a change in the image of cities. The fourth part finally asks, using the example of American and Japanese television productions, for criteria by which local television series are exported to foreign cultures.

Spaces, Places, Borders: On the Way to a Sociology of Space ¤ Claptext: The development of modernity can be described as a development from the immediately surrounding spaces to the infinitely distant spaces. While a strong bond to the near space can be observed in early tribal societies, modernity leads precisely beyond the given spaces and opens up new horizons. The complaint about the loss of community, the local, and tradition finds its starting point here. The present work argues that this binding of the social to the near relationships has long been in the way of a systematic engagement with space in sociology. Passing through central sociological theory positions and using individual case studies, not only are the effects of this privilege of proximity shown, but also the simultaneity of deterritorialization and reterritorialization processes, of openings and closures is pursued.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048561-4>
Introduction to Java ¤ The current version 9 of the programming language (or more accurately: development platform) Java again contains an important innovation: large programs can now be divided into multiple modules, which also applies to the class library. As in the predecessor to version 8, the NetBeans development environment is used for following the examples. Beginners with programming knowledge and advanced users learn with this book first basics such as data types, objects, and classes and subsequently more specialized content, for example, polymorphism, multithreading, lambda expressions, and apps with Android Studio. Very practice-oriented, with numerous code examples that can be downloaded as a zip file from the publisher's homepage, as well as exercise tasks with solutions. From the competing titles to this version, "Java for Dummies" has been published and "Schrödinger programs Java". The 1st edition can remain in stock, as Java-8 programs are executable under version 9	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401313-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/113696553X>

Patterns compact : Design Patterns for Effective Software Development ¤ Practical overview for software developers on design patterns (Design Patterns), which can be used as templates to solve recurring design problems. The slim, yet very popular in Munich, book is already in its 3rd edition and has been significantly expanded each time with new patterns, the further literature list updated. Therefore, the previous editions (ID 3/07 and ID 44/04) should be replaced. More comprehensive and completely differently designed is the further title by E. Freeman (BA 4/06), otherwise there is a lack of current comparative literature; for advanced computer science collections. (3 A)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4546895-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
The Africa Lexicon: A Continent in 1000 Keywords; with 101 Images, Maps, and Tables ¤ The long-awaited, ambitious book of the Cameroonian editor, a Berlin-based political scientist and philosopher, informs as the first German-language lexicon, comprehensively about Africa (including the Arab North). Around 200 renowned scholars have written the compact, yet easily understandable individual contributions. These are each accompanied by references to further literature. This reference work not only contains country reports, but also articles on everyday life, history, politics, law, and economy, on art, literature, language, philosophy, religion, on sciences, technology, and media. In view of many still prevailing clichés and generally lacking knowledge about Africa, this book practically leaves no questions unanswered. Unfortunately, due to space reasons, biographies of African personalities had to be omitted. - Nevertheless, this Africa Lexicon is also a worthwhile acquisition for smaller libraries - despite the proud price.

From Castle to Blob: Children Discover Architecture ¤ Using 17 buildings, children are introduced to architecture from the Middle Ages to the present. Buildings from various epochs are presented, which show typical architectural features of the style directions - from the medieval castle to the Kunsthaus Graz, a Blob (= English for drop). On each double page, there is a large-format photo of the corresponding building, further small photos show characteristic excerpts, plus the floor plan, and often a comparison with the fashion of the time. 2 children lead through the book and set small quiz questions. In the 2nd part, the buildings and their style are explained in a short text. A register explains the most important terms, in the appendix are addresses and opening hours of the buildings listed. Comparable titles on the topic for children of this age group do not exist, for older: "Famous Buildings" (BA 10/03), which deals with architecture from the early times. The attractively designed and informative book is highly recommended. - Using 17 buildings, children learn a lot about architecture and its style directions from the Middle Ages to the present in many photos and short text. From 8.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Life on the Castle: Everyday Life, Feuds, and Tournaments ¤ Richly illustrated representation of life on and around the medieval castle: castle construction, spread, and tasks, knights and castellans in everyday life and at tournaments or in war, economic environment and culture. (Olaf Kaptein) The theme of 'Castle and Knights' is extensively covered in the children's book sector, but on the non-fiction market, only A. Schlunk (BA 12/03) and 'German Knights - German Castles' (BA 11/98) can be referred to, Maurice Keen (BA 12/99) is already significantly more challenging. Following Theiss (Schlunk), Thorbecke now presents a very simple and understandable representation of life on and around the medieval castle: castle construction, spread, and tasks, knights and castellans in everyday life and at tournaments or in war, economic environment and culture. Dramatic descriptions, scandal stories, and anecdotes - often repeated from original sources - enliven the well-structured text (short chapters with indented paragraph beginnings) illustrated by miniatures from illuminated manuscripts. Unfortunately, no index, but well-structured, literature recommendations would have been desired for the expected readership. In comparison to the above-mentioned Schlunk, still more versatile, also suitable as an introduction to the Middle Ages.

Wirtschaftsgeographie : economic relationships in spatial perspective ¤ The 4th edition of the scientifically oriented textbook (lastly ID-G 22/12) remains largely unchanged in terms of content structure. In the revision, newer approaches and current developments have been incorporated, the bibliography contains numerous new sources. The authors remain committed to the 'relational approach', thus explicitly emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation with the social and economic sciences to adequately address the challenges of globalization. The strictly scientifically oriented textbook is suitable for lecturers and students of the aforementioned disciplines in a lecture accompanying manner. Possible in libraries with expanded holdings and corresponding academic audience, the previous edition can remain. More compact and less specialized is the 'Economic Geography' by E. Kulke (UTB; 6th edition 2017; lastly ID-B 43/04)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066446-6>
Physics for Engineers for Dummies : [for the kick with physics ; at a glance: finally understand the mathematical basics ; Mechanics and Thermodynamics quickly grasp ; Optics, Electricity, Atomic, Nuclear, and Solid-State Physics master] ¤ With Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Optics, Atomic, Nuclear, and Solid-State Physics, C. Thomsen covers the usual areas in 2-semester introductory courses on the physical foundations of natural and engineering sciences. In addition to engineers, students of natural sciences, teacher candidates, advanced students, and interested laymen can also benefit from the book. Only in a few places do the mathematical requirements exceed the level of the upper secondary school (mostly as part of optional supplementary sections). Physics students will not get by with this volume alone without further specialized literature (e.g. "Modern Physics", ID-G 3/10). The individual sections can be used independently of each other. Compared to ("Physics for Dummies", ID-G 50/07), the content focuses are more evenly distributed. The literature list and tasks are missing. Instead, the numerous examples in the text are designed as tasks and provided with step-by-step solutions. The colloquial tone may disturb the purists, but it whets the appetite for the subject.

The Origins of Human Communication ¤ Supported by rich empirical material from primate and infant research and the most influential theories of language philosophy, as well as a variety of striking examples from human everyday communication, he presents a sophisticated multi-stage model of language development in both individual and species-historical perspectives. Central hinge in this model are gestures - showing and pantomiming - that have evolved in the course of the development of social cooperation among primates. In these gestures, Tomasello recognizes the proto-forms of human language. In order to move from these gestural precursors to a complex linguistic communication that can then be culturally encoded, transmitted, and refined, there is, however, still a further biologically anchored but exclusively human prerequisite: a 'psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality'. This ensures that humans can adjust their perceptions and intentions to each other and make them the point of reference for their common actions. Man speaks, so to say, because he is a genuinely social being.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077740-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071050-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140571-7>
Linux Mint 19 : Practical Knowledge for New and Switching Users ¤ Linux Mint 19 (Tara) is the current version of a Linux distribution based on Linux Ubuntu. The author is also known for a book about the previous version Linux Mint 18. The book assumes no special prior knowledge from its readers. It particularly addresses switchers from Windows, who are offered an operating system with Linux Mint, which is comparable in performance to Windows, but hardly exposed to hacker attacks. The author begins with a brief description of Linux Mint and installation, where the possibility of running Linux Mint and Windows parallel on a computer is also discussed. Further focuses are then on setting up Linux Mint, the LibreOffice office software package, Linux Mint as a multi-user system, Linux Mint in the cloud, and data security. Many illustrations; didactically well prepared: hints, rules, and tips are graphically highlighted. A procurement in addition to the aforementioned Linux Lint 18 is recommended due to many innovations, e.g. in music management	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/116480278X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1195791917> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006216-8>

Biogas-Messprogramm II : 61 Biogas Plants in Comparison ; this work was prepared within the framework of the project "Federal Program for the Evaluation of New Biomass-Biogas Plants" (Funding Code: 22003405) ; the project was financed by the Agency for Renewable Resources (FNR) with funds from the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMELV) ¤ In total, the results show that there are large differences between the plants in terms of function, performance, and operational safety as well as in terms of economic efficiency. It is clear that the remuneration through the EEG is not a guarantee for the profitability of the plant operation. The correct dimensioning of the plant in combination with an optimal selection of the fermentation substrates is together with a high load of the BHKW at the same time using the available heat the key to the economic success of biogas production. Not least, the qualification of the operator plays an important role (Source: Author).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066424-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006798-1>

Antimatter ¤ The history of the discovery of antimatter, its current research, production, and storage, as well as its use as a motif in science fiction literature. (Dr. Michael Mücke) Antimatter consists of particles that are identical to known matter particles, but have exactly opposite properties. There is an antiproton and a positron as opposites to protons and electrons. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other and a huge amount of energy is released. This has provided material for numerous science fiction novels, but in reality, both the production and storage of antimatter pose enormous, technically almost insurmountable problems, as author Frank Close, a physics professor in Oxford, explains in detail. But first, he reports on the history of antimatter, its discovery in cosmic radiation, the prediction of a positive electron by Paul Dirac, and the conditions for its production. F. Close writes clearly and easily understandable and knows how to clearly separate facts and wishful thinking of science fiction authors. Highly recommended for all readers who are interested in natural sciences. (2 pages) (Dr. Michael Mücke)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142686-1>
HAM-ANS on tour : Report on a US Trip ¤ From the introduction: As in 1983, in 1984, employees of the HAM-ANS project (Hamburg application-oriented natural language system) had the opportunity to conduct a lecture and information trip to the USA.

Introduction to Semiconductor Circuit Technology ¤ The goal of this introductory textbook is to convey the principles and operation of semiconductor components and circuits. On the accompanying CD-ROM, there is the interactive learning program S.m.i.L.E. developed at a university for illustrating the complex relationships treated in the book, as well as P-Spice files for testing the circuits from the book, and the student version of the simulation program OrCAD-Pspice 9.1. The material is based on a lecture and is therefore aimed at students and corresponding practitioners. Most recently, on the topic M. Reisch (BA 2/05) and T. Tilli (ID 2/05) appeared, but both do not contain as helpful software as the present book. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158811-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113826-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272489-2>
Physics of Semiconductor Components: An Introductory Textbook for Engineers and Physicists ¤ This textbook provides an introduction to the physics of semiconductor components, with emphasis on the underlying physical principles. It is particularly aimed at students of electrical and information technology and technical physics at universities of applied sciences, as well as aspiring physicists who want to familiarize themselves with the applications of semiconductor physics. The fundamental facts and equations are presented with detailed derivations.

... confronted with death suddenly : a guide for kindergartens with emergency plans, checklists, and aids for bereavement accompaniment ¤ Loss, death, and grief are recurring themes in kindergartens and pose a challenge to the pedagogical sensitivity of educators. A practical guide to accompanying younger children in their grief. (Birgitta Negel-Täuber) Even small children are already confronted with death, loss, and grief. The way to deal with this in kindergarten daily life varies in intensity, depending on how close the deceased person was to the institution (e.g. the school bus driver, a caregiver dies after a long illness, stillbirth in a child's family). In accordance with the temporal course of grief work, checklists for initial reactions (who is informed?, participation in the funeral?) make the beginning. Short- and long-term pedagogical accompaniment, parent work, and processing of the grief case in the group with many suggestions (songs, rituals, conversations) take up the vast majority of space. A table on possible reactions of children, depending on age, a glossary around the topic of death and burial, as well as an excursion on burial rituals in other religions round off the practical guide. The only known comparable title is hardly still available anywhere (G. Ennulat: "Accompanying children in their grief", BA 1/99), which is why it is recommended more broadly.

Agglomerationsräume in Deutschland : Views, Insights, Prospects ¤ Through the internationalization and globalization of economic relationships and markets, Western European integration, the opening of borders to Central and Eastern Europe, and German reunification, the location competition between agglomeration areas has been significantly and sustainably intensified. Against this backdrop, the members of the ARL working group "Development and Problems of Agglomeration Areas in Germany" have set themselves the goal of not only dealing with the economic factors of the development of city regions, but also placing the consequences for social, political, and cultural development at the center of their considerations. In this context, cross-sectional regional case studies and theme-related processing of specialist aspects complement each other. In the sixteen contributions to the volume, a broad range of topics is addressed, ranging from poverty development and questions of regional identity to the assessment of agglomeration development from a feminist perspective to concrete municipal and regional development approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069106-8>

Medicinal Residues in Recyclates of Phosphorus Recovery from Sewage Sludge: Final Report ¤ Currently, there are data gaps regarding medicinal residues in sewage sludge and the phosphorus recycling products (P-recyclates) produced from it. The project aimed to investigate phosphorus recovery and carbonization plants in Germany regarding the following medicinal substances: Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Clarithromycin, Carbamazepin, 17-α-Ethinylestradiol, Diclofenac, Cefuroxim, Sulfamethoxazol, 17-β-Estradiol, Metoprolol, and Bezafibrat. The study clearly shows that phosphorus recovery processes significantly reduce the medicinal load in P-recyclates compared to the starting materials such as sewage sludge. The results were discussed at a technical workshop.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7742132-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351872-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045855-6>
Erfolgsfaktor Standortplanung : in- and foreign locations correctly evaluate ; with 40 tables ¤ The evaluation of international production locations becomes increasingly important for companies. Location decisions are often made primarily on cost grounds. The quotas of disappointed re-locators show that the risk of failure is high. In addition to internal company reasons such as limited planning capacities, methodical causes can also be identified for these wrong decisions. How can the critical parameters for the respective location strategy be identified? Is the network requirement at the respective location taken into account? The authors present proven methods in practice, how industrial companies can subject their existing company locations to a strategically founded evaluation in comparison with international location alternatives, which does not remain at the level of a static cost comparison. A book for practitioners in industrial companies as well as for scientists dealing with international management and location decisions.

Tuition Fees and Their Social Impacts: An Analysis of Data from the USA, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand ¤ Methodically, the investigation of tuition fees and their social impacts is based on the concept of law and economics, a research branch of institutional economics. In principle, methodological individualism is assumed. The system behavior is reduced to individual actions. Individuals are assigned certain characteristics (preferences) that do not disappear or change when interacting with other individuals. In the background of the investigation, the question stands whether in Germany or in other countries, more academics are needed, whether additional financing needs exist, whether the state provides sufficient financial means, and whether a shift of a part of the financing to the private side improves the situation or only leads to a faster withdrawal of the state from the financing.

Sustainability in Ecology: Paths to a Future-Proof World ¤ The most pressing problems of an environment oriented towards sustainability are collected here. The book is based on a public lecture series within the framework of EXPO 2000, organized by the Research Institute for Philosophy Hanover. At the center is the term of sustainability, which has been used since the 1992 Rio Environment Summit, often and indeed somewhat vaguely, and is of central importance to environmental sciences. From a completely different perspective; i.e. from recognized experts of various disciplines, it is illuminated and put to the test. In their texts, the authors (biologists, politicians, theologians, philosophers, historians, economists) ask questions, articulate demands, describe situations. A profound title for the current debate, indispensable for large public libraries.

Maschinenwinter : Knowledge, Technology, Socialism ; a Polemical Essay ¤ It is well known that it is not the machines that shut down machines, but people who build and use them. Therefore, it is no longer acceptable that machines increasingly worsen living conditions, although they were originally intended to improve them. Even in the richest countries, there is little to be seen of relief from technology: The creative computer consultant lives a biblical day laborer's existence; the high-tech doctor writes reports on the alms entitlement of sick beneficiaries; every modernization of production means mass layoffs instead of reduced working hours. But not even access to these relatively luxurious forms of misery is granted to poorer regions; everything is simply outsourced there that cannot be done with Western wage earners for the time being. How can one storm the machines to take possession of them? Can one maintain modern division of labor, but get rid of the hierarchies, dependencies, and injustices that cling to it? What do industry, the wealth created by it, and the dirt thrown out by it have to do with freedom? The essay Maschinenwinter risks a literary, political, polemical, and speculative fantasy about how one could make history with technology	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198902-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1>
Bathrooms : plan, renovate, redesign ¤ Suggestions for the installation or redesign of a bathroom. First, it needs to be clarified whether one wants it brave or flippant, elegant or cheerful. Then comes the financing and planning with the craftsmen, not to forget the temperature control of the room and warm water. Checklists and tips for the right purchase are missing just as much as guidelines for safety in the bathroom for children, seniors, and people with disabilities. Finally, a wellness oasis is described. In this book, it is less about DIY work for DIYers, but about planning and cooperation with craftsmen. For DIYers, the book "Bathrooms self-build and modernize" (BA 8/03) is recommended. Whereby, for planning, this book should also be recommended to the DIYer.

Long-term Archiving of Research Data: A Stocktaking ¤ The importance of research data for science and the development of digital research processes is increasingly recognized by science itself, but also by politics and funders. Research data and long-term access to them are of great importance to researchers in all disciplines: as proof of the research process and its results, for reuse in the framework of interdisciplinary cooperation or for comparative analyses, where research is conducted with new methods or under changed conditions. All this is only possible if research data are secured, archived for long-term reuse, and made available. In view of rapidly growing digital data volumes, long-term archiving of research data is a supporting infrastructure task for all scientific disciplines. So far, there has been no comprehensive stocktaking in the German science landscape. In the present investigation, researchers from eleven disciplinary fields - specifically humanities, social sciences, psycholinguistics, pedagogy, classical studies, geosciences, climate research, biodiversity, particle physics, astronomy, and medicine - systematically presented the current state and practice of handling long-term archiving of research data in their respective disciplinary field. The results were aggregated in a summarizing analysis and prepared for science and politics in the form of theses and the presented action fields. The editors, who have been engaged in research and qualification in the field of long-term archiving for years, want to contribute to this stocktaking to enable future concepts and measures for long-term archiving of research data to be formulated on a scientifically verifiable and substantial basis for science, funding organizations, and politics. In this sense, they understand this book as a contribution to the infrastructure development of the German research landscape. [With a foreword by Prof. Dr.-Ing.

Excel 2019 : All-in-One for Dummies ¤ Already this year, the author has published a Dummies guide to Excel 2019. The present book consists, like its predecessor, of 8 "books", which, however, seem to have been completely revised after comparing the contents lists. The comparison of both Dummies guides shows that there are some overlaps, but the present one deals with many individual topics to a greater extent. This book also presents itself in the new Dummies layout, which is still not an advantage is the smaller font. Screenshots and illustrations support the instructions. This edition has 52 pages more, yet it is cheaper than the predecessor. It is also practical as a reference work. Libraries with a tight budget could just as well decide on Helmut Vonhoegen: "Comprehensive Handbook to Excel 2019", as it is more extensive but cheaper. Due to the numerous changes, it is advisable to replace the previous edition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138932-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1176064932>
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics : with 44 Problems and Complete Solution Paths ¤ BEGIN - What problems arise in relativistic extensions of the Schrödinger theory, especially when one holds to the usual one-particle probability interpretation? - To what extent can these difficulties be overcome? - What is the physical necessity of quantum field theories? Many books only inadequately answer such fundamental understanding questions by quickly dealing with the relativistic-quantum mechanical one-particle concept in favor of an early introduction of field quantization or omitting it altogether. In contrast, the present textbook emphasizes this one-particle aspect (relativistic quantum mechanics 'in the narrower sense'), discusses the associated problems, and thus motivates the necessity of quantized fields in a physically understandable way. The first two chapters deal with the detailed presentation and comparison of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac theories - always with a view to the non-relativistic theory. In the third chapter, relativistic scattering processes are treated, and the Feynman rules are developed from propagator procedures. Here too, it becomes clear why one ultimately cannot do without a quantum field-theoretical justification. This textbook is aimed at all physics students who are interested in a clearly organized presentation of relativistic quantum mechanics 'in the narrower sense' and its demarcation from quantum field theories.

Technical Possibilities of Alternative Design of Urban Water and Sewage Infrastructure: A Technical Research within the Framework of the Project 'Transformation Management for Sustainable Water Economy' ¤ With the technical research, the research network netWORKS presents an inventory of selected national and international experiences and projects on technical possibilities of alternative design of urban supply and disposal infrastructure. The available technical possibilities and their already realized applications are shown. Implementations in the framework of research and pilot projects as well as already realized large-scale projects on alternative concepts of water supply and sewage disposal were taken into account. Gained operational experiences were evaluated as far as available. The report also serves as background information for the scenario-based game planned within the framework of the project 'Transformation Management for Sustainable Water Economy'. Due to its overview character, the study should also be of interest to other professionally interested parties from science and municipal or municipal economic practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127028-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122755-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4>
PREFAB HOUSING : Investigation of Production Processes in View of Efficiency Enhancement and Cost Reduction for Demand-Responsive Housing ¤ Starting from the ongoing and pressing debates on strategies for demand-responsive and affordable housing, this study deals with prefabricated building systems and examines the contribution they can make to the development of a more sustainable housing construction. On the one hand, some existing systems are presented and their production processes and qualities are investigated, on the other hand, a look is taken at further developments, possible optimizations and potentials that reside in prefabricated housing. Based on a selection of various manufacturers, a current state of affairs is described in the field of industrial and serial construction. The companies are representative of various construction methods and the use of different materials. In addition to the degree of prefabrication, which initially refers to the manufactured elements or modules and subsequently to the building as a total product, the topics of automation, standardization, and integration of planning and production processes are also evaluated. While the offered systems for the most part have a very high degree of prefabrication and achieve a relatively high productivity through standardization, potentials on the fields of automation and above all digital integration are not exhaustively exploited. In comparison with other industries, technical developments have not yet been established to the same extent in serial construction. Therefore, there is a special development potential for increasing efficiency, reducing error rates, and optimizing production processes, from which the further dissemination, competitiveness, and also the acceptance of prefabricated building systems depend. This study is intended to represent a location determination in view of this development process and provide an insight into approaches and possibilities of prefabricated housing construction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154137-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004822-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329754-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016887-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276531-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156130-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154155-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509392-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240895-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443806-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004821-4>

Atlas of the Ruhr Metropolis: Diversity and Change of the Ruhr Region in Map Images ¤ Over 70 authors from science and practice document the development of the Ruhr region from a significant industrial region to the rising metropolis of Ruhr using many illustrative maps, which are supplemented by photos and informative contributions. The atlas is divided into 5 large chapters. Starting with overview articles, the authors then deal with history (from the 19th century), structural change, and urban lifestyles in the multicultural region. The spatial reorientation of some district towns is illustrated by selected examples, such as the redevelopment of the Duisburg inner harbor. During reading, one repeatedly comes across interesting things, such as a chapter on literary settings of the Ruhr region.

Molecular Biology of the Cell ¤ Since 1986, this "classic of modern biological textbooks for universities" (H. Lüdtke for the 4th edition: ID 9/04) has been praised as "extremely sovereign and competent representation of the entire general biology" and "great textbook of the central area of general biology (Bock)" for the first German editions. It is currently in its 6th edition. Since its last appearance, approximately 5 million scientific articles have been published in the field. Consequently, the textbook has been significantly revised in content while maintaining its basic structure: new functions of RNA molecules, new information on the human genome, stem cell research, cancer therapy, etc. In return, it has been strongly concentrated and "to keep the book portable" (preface) also reduced by 300 pages. The DVD supplement, which also offered the text of the English edition, has been omitted, and instead, reference is made to video material on the homepage.

Modeling and formal analysis of meta-ecosystems with dynamic structure using Graph Transformation ¤ The dynamics of ecosystems is of crucial importance. Various model-based approaches exist to understand and analyze their internal effects. In this paper, we model the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of meta-ecosystems using the formal technique of Graph Transformation (short GT). We build GT models to describe how a meta-ecosystem (modeled as a graph) can evolve over time (modeled by GT rules) and to analyze these GT models with respect to qualitative properties such as the existence of structural stabilities. As a case study, we build three GT models describing the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of three different savanna meta-ecosystems. The first GT model considers a savanna meta-ecosystem that is limited in space to two ecosystem patches, whereas the other two GT models consider two savanna meta-ecosystems that are unlimited in the number of ecosystem patches and only differ in one GT rule describing how the space structure of the meta-ecosystem grows. In the first two GT models, the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of the meta-ecosystem shows two main structural stabilities: the first one based on grassland-savanna-woodland transitions and the second one based on grassland-desert transitions. The transition between these two structural stabilities is driven by high-intensity fires affecting the tree components. In the third GT model, the GT rule for savanna regeneration induces desertification and therefore a collapse of the meta-ecosystem. We believe that GT models provide a complementary avenue to that of existing approaches to rigorously study ecological phenomena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043216-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274073-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2>
Future Market Electric Energy Storage : Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action (Project Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ Energy storage serves to balance between the fluctuating energy supply and the changing energy demand. In terms of power supply, the offer and demand must be balanced at all times in the electrical networks. This can be achieved by controlling power generation, power demand, or intermediate storage. Power storage systems can balance both supply peaks (charging) and demand peaks (discharging). Energy storage systems will be an indispensable component for power supply from fluctuating and possibly decentralized energy sources in the future, ensuring a stable operation. There are a variety of possible storage technologies with different properties and application areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014722-8>
Luck, Logic and Bluff: Mathematics in Games; Methods, Results and Limits ¤ As "challenging, but very stimulating" recommended reviewer Martin A. Lobeck the material- and thought-rich, richly illustrated, and equipped with an attractive cover, the book, which has the mathematical background of random, combinatorial, and strategic game elements as the subject (1st edition: BA 1/99). From dice, lottery, chess computers, Black Jack, Reversi, Domino or Backgammon, the diploma mathematician and managing director of a game device company comes to probability calculation, combinatorics, and game theory. With all mathematical accuracy - even math-phobic players come to their cost in reading, because they, for example, find precise value indicators for all streets at "Monopoly" and also receive numerous concrete hints on game descriptions. Reprints (not shown here) brought improvements and minor content additions. The now available, expanded 4th edition with a new approach to game theory offers the possibility of first or replacement purchase.

Virtualization and Cloud Computing : Concepts, Technology Study, Market Overview ¤ Virtualization and Cloud Computing are currently among the most important buzzwords for operators of IT infrastructures. There are a wide variety of different technologies, products, and business models for completely different application scenarios. The present study first provides a detailed overview of current developments in concepts and technologies of virtualization technology – from classical server virtualization to infrastructure for virtual workplaces to application virtualization and attempts to classify virtualization variants. When considering the Cloud Computing concept, its basic principles, various architecture variants, and application cases are introduced. The detailed examination of the benefits of Cloud Computing as well as possible concerns that must be taken into account when using Cloud resources in a company shows that Cloud Computing offers great opportunities, but is not suitable for every application and not for every legal and economic framework. The subsequent market overview for virtualization technology shows that the major manufacturers – Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware – each offer products for almost all virtualization variants and highlights decisive differences and the strengths of the respective providers. For example, Citrix's solution for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures is very mature, while Microsoft can only rely on standard technology here. VMware, as market leader, has found the greatest dissemination in data centers and offers true fault tolerance as the only manufacturer. Microsoft, on the other hand, scores with the seamless integration of its virtualization products into existing Windows infrastructures. In the area of Cloud Computing systems, some open-source software projects are shown to be suitable for productive operation of so-called private clouds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200434-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4839180-3>
How can existing national climate policy instruments contribute to ETS development? : final report ¤ The research project “Perspectives of Linking Emission Trading Systems – Possibilities to Transition National Climate Programmes into an ETS” seeks to analyse and evaluate non-ETS climate policy instruments, such as carbon taxes or green certificate trading schemes, regarding their suitability to serve as a basis for establishing emission trading systems. The analysis proceeded in two steps: first, a generic assessment of prototypical policy instruments was made. In a second step, case studies of realworld implementation in India and Mexico were conducted. Findings from this project are meant to inform ETS development by showing how existing policy instruments could contribute to this process and by illustrating how non-ETS policy instruments could coexist with an emissions trading system, allowing for an effective policy mix. This report represents the consolidated findings of three work packages within this research project. The first chapter provides some background information while chapter 2 introduces main concepts that represent the basis for the analysis of prototypical policy instruments in chapter 3. In a brief excursus we look at policy instrument’s benefits that could represent a barrier to the introduction of an ETS (chapter 4). the findings from the case studies Mexico and India are presented in the chapters 6 and 7, respectively. In chapter 8 we look at the co-existence of climate and energy policy instruments in the European Union and how the experiences made could inform other regions in terms of operating an ETS in parallel to other policies. Section 9 summarizes the findings providing an outlook on how the development of an ETS could be supported by taking into account existing instruments and how these could synergistically be combined with an ETS allowing for a transition towards a low carbon economy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>

C++ with Borland C++Builder 2007: Introduction to the C++ Standard and Object-Oriented Windows Programming ¤ Introduced to the development of object-oriented C++ applications including web applications. Addressed to beginners without special prior knowledge. This is possible despite the complexity of C++ programming, as the book relies on the current version of the Borland C++ Builder. The Borland C++ Builder is a manageable development environment for visual C++ programming. A previous version of the Borland C++ Builder is described in detail by D. Abels (BA 1/01). The new edition (first edition not discussed) is necessary due to the further development of the Borland C++ Builder. Extensions and additions compared to the previous edition concern systematic tests and unit tests, programming logic and program verification as well as object-oriented analysis and design. A focus of the representation lies in a comprehensive reference to the C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2003), where all important language elements are systematically presented. Also well considered are graphic programming and working with Windows API functions. Exercises. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7604775-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193909-8>

Did Germany reach its 2020 climate targets thanks to COVID-19? ¤ In this paper, we estimate the effects of COVID-19 on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Germany in 2020 at the sectoral and national level. Counterfactual emissions are estimated based on autoregressive econometric models and distinguish between different factors of emissions based on decomposition analysis. Our findings at the national level suggest that COVID-19 lowered GHG emissions in 2020 in Germany by about 45 Mt CO2-eq (6.1%). Accordingly, about two-thirds of the reduction in emissions between 2019 and 2020 in Germany may be attributed to COVID-19. Our findings at the sectoral level imply that all sectors, with the exception of the transport sector, would have met their emissions target in 2020 without COVID-19. Thus, for the buildings sector and the transport sector, our results suggest policy responses that differ from those pursued by the German government to comply with the provisions of the Federal Climate Change Act.

High-frequency averaging in semi-classical Hartree-type equations ¤ We investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to semi-classical Schröodinger equations with nonlinearities of Hartree type. For a weakly nonlinear scaling, we show the validity of an asymptotic superposition principle for slowly modulated highly oscillatory pulses. The result is based on a high-frequency averaging effect due to the nonlocal nature of the Hartree potential, which inhibits the creation of new resonant waves. In the proof we make use of the framework of Wiener algebras.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278277-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190133-2>

Market competition in the nuclear industry ¤ Nuclear power plants require a wide variety of specialised equipment, materials and services for their construction, operation and fuelling. There has been much consolidation and retrenchment in the nuclear industry since the 1980s, with the emergence of some large global nuclear companies. Electricity market liberalisation in many OECD countries has meanwhile placed nuclear plant operators under increased competitive pressure.These structural changes in both the producer and consumer sides of the nuclear industry have had implications for the level of competition in the nuclear engineering and fuel cycle markets. With renewed expansion of nuclear power now anticipated, this study examines competition in the major nuclear industry sectors at present, and how this may change with a significant upturn in demand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030318-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6>

The font engineering platform : collaborative font creation in a self-supporting programming environment ¤ Creating fonts is a complex task that requires expert knowledge in a variety of domains. Often, this knowledge is not held by a single person, but spread across a number of domain experts. A central concept needed for designing fonts is the glyph, an elemental symbol representing a readable character. Required domains include designing glyph shapes, engineering rules to combine glyphs for complex scripts and checking legibility. This process is most often iterative and requires communication in all directions. This report outlines a platform that aims to enhance the means of communication, describes our prototyping process, discusses complex font rendering and editing in a live environment and an approach to generate code based on a user’s live-edits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053297-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131397-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7>
Improving efficiency of coupled schemes for Navier-Stokes equations by a connection to grad-div stabilitzed projection methods ¤ We prove that in finite element settings where the divergence-free subspace of the velocity space has optimal approximation properties, the solution of Chorin/Temam projection methods for Navier-Stokes equations equipped with grad-div stabilization with parameter , converge to the associated coupled method solution with rate gamma as gamma -> ?. We prove this first for backward Euler schemes, and then extend the results to BDF2 schemes, and finally to schemes with outflow boundary conditions.

Signal extraction : efficient estimation, "unit root"-tests and early detection of turning points ¤ The book provides deep insights into the signal extraction problem - especially at the boundary of a sample, where asymmetric filters must be used - and how to solve it optimally. The traditional model-based approach (TRAMO/SEATS or X-12-ARIMA) is an inefficient estimation method because it relies on one-step ahead forecasting performances (of a model) whereas the signal extraction problem implicitly requires good multi-step ahead forecasts also. Unit roots are important properties of the input signal because they generate a set of constraints for the best extraction filter. Since traditional tests essentially rely on one-step ahead forecasting performances, new tests are presented here which implicitly account for multi-step ahead forecasting performances too. The gain in efficiency obtained by the new estimation method is analyzed in great detail, using simulated data as well as 'real world	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4260601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054943-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187413-4>

Partial differential equations ¤ This self-contained text offers an elementary introduction to partial differential equations (pdes), primarily focusing on linear equations, but also providing some perspective on nonlinear equations. The classical treatment is mathematically rigorous with a generally theoretical layout, though indications to some of the physical origins of pdes are made throughout in references to potential theory, similarity solutions for the porous medium equation, generalized Riemann problems, and others. The material begins with a focus on the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem, discussing the notion of characteristic surfaces to classify pdes. Next, the Laplace equation and connected elliptic theory are treated, as well as integral equations and solutions to eigenvalue problems. The heat equation and related parabolic theory are then presented, followed by the wave equation in its basic aspects. An introduction to conservation laws, the uniqueness theorem, viscosity solutions, ill-posed problems, and nonlinear equations of first order round out the key subject matter. Large parts of this revised second edition have been streamlined and rewritten to incorporate years of classroom feedback, correct errors, and improve clarity. Most of the necessary background material has been incorporated into the complements and certain nonessential topics have been given reduced attention (noticeably, numerical methods) to improve the flow of presentation. The exposition is replete with examples, problems and solutions that complement the material to enhance understanding and solidify comprehension. The only prerequisites are advanced differential calculus and some basic Lp theory. The work can serve as a text for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, physics, engineering, and the natural sciences, as well as an excellent reference for applied mathematicians and mathematical physicists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044779-0>

Decreasing costs of renewables : implications for Indonesia's climate targets ¤ The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, to reach 2034 MtCO2eq in 2030. It further specifies that the energy sector shall take a share of 37.6% of this mitigation effort to reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU, reaching 1355 MtCO2eq emissions in 2030. This study analyses how falling cost projections of renewable energy technologies (solar PV and wind energy) could inform energy sector and climate change mitigation plans of Indonesia. We show that cost projections valid for Indonesia for renewable energies have dramatically fallen over the past years. Costs projected for 2030 a couple of years ago are well undercut by more recent projections for 2030. Recent cost projections for 2030 for wind energy are 31% lower than projections dating from 2015, solar PV cost projections have fallen by 49% on average. If falling costs for renewables are considered, the renewable capacities given in RUEN (the National Energy Master Plan) could be revised at constant investments. The overall renewable energy capacity given in RUEN for 2030 could be increased from 70 GW to 85 GW. Solar PV would become the dominant source of renewable energy, wind energy would slightly surpass geothermal power generation. This increase in renewable capacities could inform the revision of Indonesia's NDC. If falling cost projections of renewables are considered, the unconditional target could be reduced from 2034 MtCO2eq to 2005 MtCO2eq at constant costs. This corresponds an increase from 29% to 30.1% reduction and presents a 9.1% increase in the ambition of the energy sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

Interval probabilistic timed graph transformation systems ¤ The formal modeling and analysis is of crucial importance for software development processes following the model based approach. We present the formalism of Interval Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (IPTGTSs) as a high-level modeling language. This language supports structure dynamics (based on graph transformation), timed behavior (based on clocks, guards, resets, and invariants as in Timed Automata (TA)), and interval probabilistic behavior (based on Discrete Interval Probability Distributions). That is, for the probabilistic behavior, the modeler using IPTGTSs does not need to provide precise probabilities, which are often impossible to obtain, but rather provides a probability range instead from which a precise probability is chosen nondeterministically. In fact, this feature on capturing probabilistic behavior distinguishes IPTGTSs from Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) presented earlier. Following earlier work on Interval Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) and PTGTSs, we also provide an analysis tool chain for IPTGTSs based on inter-formalism transformations. In particular, we provide in our tool AutoGraph a translation of IPTGTSs to IPTA and rely on a mapping of IPTA to Probabilistic Timed Automata (PTA) to allow for the usage of the Prism model checker. The tool Prism can then be used to analyze the resulting PTA w.r.t. probabilistic real-time queries asking for worst-case and best-case probabilities to reach a certain set of target states in a given amount of time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4713349-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121894-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238872-7>

Dynamic optimization and differential games ¤ DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION AND DIFFERENTIAL GAMES has been written to address the increasing number of Operations Research and Management Science problems (that is, applications) that involve the explicit consideration of time and of gaming among multiple agents. It is a book that will be used both as a textbook and as a reference and guide to engineers, operation researchers, applied mathematicians and social scientists whose work involves the theoretical aspects of dynamic optimization and differential games. Included throughout the text are detailed explanations of several original dynamic and game-theoretic mathematical models, which are of particular relevance in today's technologically-driven-global economy: revenue management, supply chain management, electric power systems, urban freight systems, dynamic congestion pricing, dynamic traffic assignment, electronic commerce and the Internet. In addition, there will be some more traditional applications with useful pedagogical content included in Chapter 1. The book combines an emphasis on deterministic models and methods along with an introduction to stochastic optimal control and stochastic differential games. And most important, the book covers both theory and applications. It develops the key results of deterministic, continuous time, optimal control theory from both the classical calculus of variations perspectives and the more modern approach of infinite dimensional mathematical programming. Infinite dimensional mathematical programming provides greater utility for solving continuous-time-differential-game problems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125677-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012253-0>
Econocide : British slavery in the era of abolition ¤ Cliff notes of the 2nd edition: In this classic analysis and refutation of Eric Williams's 1944 thesis, Seymour Drescher argues that Britain's abolition of the slave trade in 1807 resulted not from the diminishing value of slavery for Great Britain but instead from the British public's mobilization against the slave trade, which forced London to commit what Drescher terms "econocide." This action, he argues, was detrimental to Britain's economic interests at a time when British slavery was actually at the height of its potential. Originally published in 1977, Drescher's work was instrumental in undermining the economic determinist interpretation of abolitionism that had dominated historical discourse for decades following World War II. For this second edition, which includes a foreword by David Brion Davis, Drescher has written a new preface, reflecting on the historiography of the British slave trade since this book's original publication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055260-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200586-3>

A charging infrastructure network for battery electric trucks in Europe ¤ Facing climate change, The European Union has set ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Within Europe, heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) account for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and therefore plays a central role in achieving the climate targets. A potential solution to reduce GHG emissions is the use of battery electric vehicles (BEV). However, the limited range of BEV requires a European public fast-charging network to ensure widespread deployment of BEV. Here, European road freight transport flows are modelled based on the publicly available European Transport policy Information System (ETISplus) dataset. The resulting truck flows serve as input for a charging infrastructure network model. Potential charging stations are located using a coverage-oriented approach and sized according to a queuing model such that an average waiting time of five minutes is guaranteed at each location. Our results show that for a share of 15% BEV in HDV stock and a dense network with charging locations every 50 km, a total of 4,067 charging points at 1,640 locations are required by 2030. In contrast, with a share of 5% BEV and charging locations every 100 km, 1,715 charging points are needed at 812 locations. Our findings provide insights for the design of a public fastcharging network in Europe and thus supports the planning of future infrastructure projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062953-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023745712> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2>

Inhibitory rules in data analysis : a rough set approach ¤ This monograph is devoted to theoretical and experimental study of inhibitory decision and association rules. Inhibitory rules contain on the right-hand side a relation of the kind "attribut does not equal value." The use of inhibitory rules instead of deterministic (standard) ones allows us to describe more completely information encoded in decision or information systems and to design classifiers of high quality. ", "The most important feature of this monograph is that it includes an advanced mathematical analysis of problems on inhibitory rules. We consider algorithms for construction of inhibitory rules, bounds on minimal complexity of inhibitory rules, and algorithms for construction of the set of all minimal inhibitory rules. We also discuss results of experiments with standard and lazy classifiers based on inhibitory rules. These results show that inhibitory decision and association rules can be used in data mining and knowledge discovery both for knowledge representation and for prediction. Inhibitory rules can also be used under the analysis and design of concurrent systems. ", "These results obtained in the monograph can be useful for researchers in such areas as machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery, especially for those who are working in rough set theory, test theory, and logical analysis of data (LAD. The monograph can be used under the creation of courses for graduate students and for Ph.D. studies."--BOOK JACKET	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4738328-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024371-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152406-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4362502-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5>

Practical hydroinformatics : computational intelligence and technological developments in water applications ¤ Hydroinformatics has emerged over the last decade to become a recognised and established field of independent research activities within the hydrological and environmental science communities. Hydroinformatics is not just an application of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to water resources, hydraulics, hydrology or environment. It strives to provide an amalgamation of water science with modern technologies for the purposes of satisfying social requirements. The European Geosciences Union (EGU) held its first dedicated session on Hydroinformatics in 2005 at the Vienna Meeting; that same meeting voted to establish the Hydroinformatics Sub-Division and Technical Committee (part of the Hydrological Sciences Division). The aim of that original session was to provide an active forum in which to demonstrate and discuss the integration and appropriate application of emergent computational technologies in a water modelling context. The initial proposal for this book arose at that meeting out of a desire to collect together a range of different contributions from academics and practitioners working in various sectors across the field; there were no other published compendiums at that point which attempted to span the latest set of methods or topics of hydrological interest that were presented at our meeting. The starting point for the selection of authors was the session itself. Further contributors were invited to submit papers in order to bolster particular sections and provide a representative selection of research across the main thematic areas: neural networks, fuzzy logic, global and evolutionary optimisation, emerging technologies and model integration. This book is aimed at hydrologists, scientists, students and practitioners interested in a set of techniques derived largely from artificial and computational intelligence to solve a range of problems in hydrology. We hope that this book will promote the field of Hydroinformatics and bridge the gap between theory and practice. We would like to thank the chapter authors for their interesting contributions and the many reviewers who have helped to make this a useful and high-quality publication. We would also like to thank the publication team at Springer for their efficient services.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455833-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026309-5>

Applied Reliability ¤ It's been over 15 years since the publication of the 2nd edition of Applied Reliability. We continue to receive positive feedback from old users, and each year hundreds of engineers, quality specialists, and statisticians discover the book for the first time and become new fans. So why a 3rd edition? There are always new methods and techniques that update and improve upon older methods, but that was not the primary reason we felt the need to write a new edition. In the last 15 years, the ready availability of relatively inexpensive, powerful, statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data. Problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming for even experts now can be solved with a few well-chosen clicks of a mouse. Additionally, with the quantitative solution often comes a plethora of graphics that aid in understanding and presenting the results. All this power comes with a price, however. Software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases, especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis. Also, in some cases different well-known software packages use different methods and output different answers. An analyst needs to know how to use these programs effectively and which methods are the most highly recommended. This information is hard to find for industrial reliability problems. This popular book is an easy-to-use guide that addresses basic descriptive statistics, reliability concepts, the exponential distribution, the Weibull distribution, the lognormal distribution, reliability data plotting, acceleration models, life test data analysis and systems models, and much more. The third edition includes a new chapter on Bayesian reliability analysis and expanded, updated coverage of repairable system modeling. Taking a practical and example-oriented approach to reliability analysis, it also provides detailed illustrations of software implementation throughout using several widely available software packages.

Extending a Java virtual machine to dynamic object-oriented languages ¤ There are two common approaches to implement a virtual machine (VM) for a dynamic object-oriented language. On the one hand, it can be implemented in a C-like language for best performance and maximum control over the resulting executable. On the other hand, it can be implemented in a language such as Java that allows for higher-level abstractions. These abstractions, such as proper object-oriented modularization, automatic memory management, or interfaces, are missing in C-like languages but they can simplify the implementation of prevalent but complex concepts in VMs, such as garbage collectors (GCs) or just-in-time compilers (JITs). Yet, the implementation of a dynamic object-oriented language in Java eventually results in two VMs on top of each other (double stack), which impedes performance. For statically typed languages, the Maxine VM solves this problem; it is written in Java but can be executed without a Java virtual machine (JVM). However, it is currently not possible to execute dynamic object-oriented languages in Maxine. This work presents an approach to bringing object models and execution models of dynamic object-oriented languages to the Maxine VM and the application of this approach to Squeak/Smalltalk. The representation of objects in and the execution of dynamic object-oriented languages pose certain challenges to the Maxine VM that lacks certain variation points necessary to enable an effortless and straightforward implementation of dynamic object-oriented languages' execution models. The implementation of Squeak/Smalltalk in Maxine as a feasibility study is to unveil such missing variation points.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4541748-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125677-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172311-9>

MDE settings in SAP : a descriptive field study ¤ MDE techniques are more and more used in praxis. However, there is currently a lack of detailed reports about how different MDE techniques are integrated into the development and combined with each other. To learn more about such MDE settings, we performed a descriptive and exploratory field study with SAP, which is a worldwide operating company with around 50.000 employees and builds enterprise software applications. This technical report describes insights we got during this study. For example, we identified that MDE settings are subject to evolution. Finally, this report outlines directions for future research to provide practical advises for the application of MDE settings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126457-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4610511-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137282-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308224-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4595331-4>

Foundations of rule learning ¤ Rules -- the clearest, most explored and best understood form of knowledge representation -- are particularly important for data mining, as they offer the best tradeoff between human and machine understandability. This book presents the fundamentals of rule learning as investigated in classical machine learning and modern data mining. It introduces a feature-based view, as a unifying framework for propositional and relational rule learning, thus bridging the gap between attribute-value learning and inductive logic programming, and providing complete coverage of most important elements of rule learning.The book can be used as a textbook for teaching machine learning, as well as a comprehensive reference to research in the field of inductive rule learning. As such, it targets students, researchers and developers of rule learning algorithms, presenting the fundamental rule learning concepts in sufficient breadth and depth to enable the reader to understand, develop and apply rule learning techniques to real-world data. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389503-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5>
Container terminals and automated transport systems : logistics control issues and quantitative decision support ¤ Container transportation is the predominant mode of inter-continental cargo traffic. Since container ships and port terminals involve a huge capital investment and significant daily operating costs, it is of crucial importance to efficiently utilize the internal resources of container terminals and transportation systems. Today there is an ongoing trend to use automated container handling and transportation technology, in particular, in countries with high labour costs. This in turn requires highly sophisticated control strategies in order to meet the desired performance measures. The primary objective of this book is to reflect these recent developments and to present new insights and successful solutions to operational problems of automated container terminals and transportation systems. It comprises reports on the state of the art, applications of quantitative methods, as well as case studies and simulation results. Its contributions are written by leading experts from academia and business. The book addresses practitioners as well as academic researchers in logistics, transportation, and management.

The repopulation of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ¤ In November 2005, New Orleans city leaders asked RAND to estimate the repopulation of the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Bring New Orleans Back Commission needed estimates of the city's population in the immediate future (the next three to six months) and the near-term future (the next one to three years) to guide the redevelopment planning process. The study was completed in early January 2006. A conceptual framework based on the costs and benefits of migration and on the role of social networks and physical constraints guided the estimates. Housing habitability was determined to be the key driver of the future population of New Orleans. RAND developed an approach to estimating future population for four points in time based on estimates of housing habitability, which were, in turn, determined by floodwater depth and the pace of housing reconstruction, as well as an estimate of the pre-Katrina population by the condition of its housing after Katrina. An important role for policymakers in shaping the repopulation process in New Orleans will be to minimize the uncertainty faced by residents and businesses by speeding up the reconstruction process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125506-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151439-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7515869-3>

How to change the world : [social entrepreneurs and the power of new ideas] ¤ David Bornstein's How to Change the World is the first book to study a remarkable and growing group of individuals around the world--what Bornstein calls social entrepreneurs. These men and women are bringing innovative, and successful, grass-roots approaches to a wide variety of social and economic problems, from rural poverty in India to discrimination against gypsies in Central Europe; from industrial pollution in the United States to child prostitution in Thailand. Like business entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs are creative, driven, and adventurous. The embrace change, exploit new opportunities, and think big. In How to Change the World, Bornstein provides vivid profiles of many such individuals, looking at the personalities, strategies, and techniques they have in common. The book is an In Search of Excellence for social initiatives, intertwining personal stories, anecdotes, and analysis. Readers will see how social entrepreneurs bring about structural changes in their societies--in other words, how one human being can make a difference.The case studies in the book include Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the international campaign against landmines she ran by e-mail from her Vermont home; Roberto Baggio, a 31-year old Brazilian who has established eighty computer schools in the slums of Brazil; and Diana Propper, who has used investment banking techniques to make American corporations responsive to environmental dangers. The paperback edition will offer a new foreword by the author that shows how the concept of social entrepreneurship has expanded and unfolded over the last few years, including the Gates-Buffetts charitable partnership, the rise of Google, and the increased mainstream coverage of the subject. The book will also update the stories of individual social entrepreneurs that appeared in the cloth edition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115404-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055737-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078599-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061949-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438961-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055710-8>

Stationary solutions for two-layer lubrication equations ¤ We investigate stationary solutions of flows of thin liquid bilayers in an energetic formulation which is motivated by the gradient flow structure of its lubrication approximation. The corresponding energy favors the liquid substrate to be only partially covered by the upper liquid. This is expressed by a negative spreading coefficient which arises from an intermolecular potential combining attractive and repulsive forces and leads to an ultra-thin layer of thickness e. For the corresponding lubrication models existence of stationary solutions is proven. In the limit e to 0 matched asymptotic analysis is applied to derive sharp-interface models and the corresponding contact angles, i.e. the Neumann triangle. In addition we use G-convergence and derive the equivalent sharp-interface models rigorously in this limit. For the resulting model existence and uniqueness of energetic minimizers are proven. The minimizers agree with solutions obtained by matched asymptotics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077970-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4209066-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7704029-6>
Low thermal expansion glass ceramics : with 21 tables ¤ This book appears in the authoritative series reporting the international research and development activities conducted by the Schott group of companies. This series provides an overview of Schott's activities for scientists, engineers, and managers from all branches of industry worldwide in which glasses and glass ceramics are of interest. Each volume begins with a chapter providing a general idea of the current problems, results, and trends relating to the subjects treated. This new extended edition describes the fundamental principles, the manufacturing process, and applications of low thermal expansion glass ceramics. The composition, structure, and stability of polycrystalline materials with a low thermal expansion are described, and it is shown how low thermal expansion glass ceramics can be manufactured from appropriately chosen glass compositions. Examples illustrate the formation of this type of glass ceramic by utilizing normal production processes together with controlled crystallization. Thus glass ceramics with thermal coefficients of expansion of less than 0.3 x 10^(-6)K^(-1) can be obtained. Even for the mass production of high-quality cooktop panels (Ceran (R)), oven windows, and other household appliances, a high reproducibility of the properties is achieved. Special glass ceramics (Zerodur (R)) for technological and scientific applications such as high-precision optics or large astronomical mirrors are also discussed. The completely revised edition also features new sections on glass-ceramic applications, with details on their performance, CDC-grinding, and laser gyroscopes containing Zerodur (R).

Engineering thermofluids : thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer ¤ The "Engineering Thermofluids" is a unique textbook, which brings the three pillars of thermal sciences; thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer under one umbrella. These three distinct, yet intertwined subjects are treated in an integrated manner. The primary audiences for this book are senior undergraduate, graduate, and practicing engineers in the fields of aeronautical, chemical industrial, mechanical, and nuclear engineering. Topics are discussed in detail while still using a simple and easy to follow approach. Numerous walk-through examples are solved and illustrations are provided to guide the reader through more subtle topics. Each chapter starts with a section for the introduction of various terminologies used. The chapter on thermodynamics covers the first law, the second law, the power cycles, and the mixture of gases. The chapter on fluid mechanics covers both steady-state and transient single phase-flow as well as two-phase flow. The chapter on heat transfer covers conduction, convection, radiation, boiling, and condensation. These chapters are followed by the chapter on applications of the engineering thermofluid, which covers the design and operations of various heat exchangers, turbomachines, and flowmeters. Many practical design problems are either solved or provided as homework. Practicing engineers will find this book a useful text to have around for the many practical problems and solutions, illustrations, definitions, methods, tables, and figures provided. The preference throughout the text is on obtaining analytical solutions of a closed form. Numerical solutions as well as experimental results are presented when analytical solutions cannot be found	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133173-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064211-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059827-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077970-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017621-6>

Compositional analysis of probabilistic timed graph transformation systems ¤ BEGIN The analysis of behavioral models is of high importance for cyber-physical systems, as the systems often encompass complex behavior based on e.g. concurrent components with mutual exclusion or probabilistic failures on demand. The rule-based formalism of probabilistic timed graph transformation systems is a suitable choice when the models representing states of the system can be understood as graphs and timed and probabilistic behavior is important. However, model checking PTGTSs is limited to systems with rather small state spaces. We present an approach for the analysis of large scale systems modeled as probabilistic timed graph transformation systems by systematically decomposing their state spaces into manageable fragments. To obtain qualitative and quantitative analysis results for a large scale system, we verify that results obtained for its fragments serve as overapproximations for the corresponding results of the large scale system. Hence, our approach allows for the detection of violations of qualitative and quantitative safety properties for the large scale system under analysis. We consider a running example in which we model shuttles driving on tracks of a large scale topology and for which we verify that shuttles never collide and are unlikely to execute emergency brakes. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our approach to the running example.
