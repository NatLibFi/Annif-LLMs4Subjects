The Mathematica guidebook for programming
This comprehensive, detailed reference to Mathematica provides the reader with both a working knowledge of Mathematica in general and a detailed knowledge of key aspects of Mathematica needed to create the fastest, shortest, and most elegant implementations possible to solve problems from the natural sciences. The GuideBook gives the user a deeper understanding of Mathematica by instructive implementations, explanations, and examples from a range of disciplines at varying levels of complexity. The GuideBook is published in three volumes -- 1 -Programming, 2-Graphics, and 3-Mathematics -- each with a CD. The 3 volumes together total 3000 pages,and contain more than 15,000 Mathematica inputs, over 1500 graphics, 4000+ references, and more than 500 exercises. The Mathematica GuideBook is an indispensible resource for students, researchers and professionals in mathematics, the sciences, and engineering will thus find a natural place on the bookshelf next to The Mathematica Book. 1-Programming, the first of the three books, covers the structure of Mathematica expressions, after an overview of the syntax of Mathematica, its programming, graphic, numeric and symbolic capabilities in chapter 1. Chapter 2-6 cover hierarchical construction of all Mathematica objects out of symbolic expressions, the definition of functions, the recognition of patterns and their efficient application, program flows and program structuring, the manipulation of lists, and additional topics. An Appendix contains some general references on algorithms and applications of computer algebra, Mathematica itself and comparisons of various algebra systems. The multiplatform CD contains Mathematica 4.0 notebooks with detailed descriptions and explanations of the Mathematica commands TOC:Introduction.- Structure of Mathematica Expressions.- Definitions and Properties of Functions.- Meta-Mathematica.- Replacement Rules and Related Matters.- Operations on Lists and Linear Algebra
