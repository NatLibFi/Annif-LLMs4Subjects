Nanoscale characterisation of ferroelectric materials : scanning probe microscopy approach
This book is a basic introduction to the field of nanoscale measurements of ferroelectric materials using scanning probe microscopy. It addresses imaging mechanisms and quantitative analysis in piezoelectric scanning probe microscopy, as well as basic physics at the nanoscale level in ferroelectrics, including nanoscale switching, scaling effects, and transport mechanisms. It will be a useful reference both for specialists and for newcomers or graduate students.
