Migration and Building Culture: Transformation of Building through Individual and Collective Immigration ¤ Since antiquity, migration movements have had a special significance for the change of building art and technology. They can be triggered, for example, by wars, political repression, voluntary decisions, or economic pressure. Again and again, cultural imprints, transformation, and displacement processes occur, whose results illustrate the stability or adaptability of a society and its building culture. The publication brings together contributions from archaeology, the history of building and construction technology, monument conservation, as well as art and architectural history. In case studies spanning epochs, the mechanisms are examined that have led to the transformation of building as a result of individual and collective immigration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165964-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165992-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059277-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144204-0>
Perspectives of Mining Heritage in Museums: Networking, Digitalization, Research ¤ The essays published in this volume, taken from a 2017 conference at the German Mining Museum in Bochum, examine mining heritage with regard to museumization, digitalization, restoration, and object research. At the same time, the volume reflects the diversity of mining’s historical legacy, which extends from associations to large museums of technology. The publication contains the contributions of a conference held at the end of 2017 by the Montanhistorisches Dokumentationszentrum (montan.dok) at the German Mining Museum in Bochum, which aimed to bring together representatives from various museums and museum institutions to discuss collections and objects in the context of museumization, digitalization, restoration, and object research. The contributions address this broad range of topics and explore the possibilities of a methodically reflected mining history. This is done with regard to object research and the use of object-related archival sources, as well as in terms of the presentation of object-related research in the digital world. The book is therefore primarily aimed at researchers in the field of mining and technology history, as well as those who are generally concerned with a material-based culture of remembrance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005614-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321156-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170787-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127665-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020517-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033560-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057195-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128844-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040795-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8>
Paul Bonatz 1877-1956 : [in conjunction with the exhibition "Paul Bonatz 1877-1956. Life and Building between Neckar and Bosporus", January 22 to March 20, 2011, hosted by the German Architecture Museum; second station of the exhibition: Kunsthalle Tübingen, March 26 to May 22, 2011] ¤ The companion book to the exhibitions "Paul Bonatz 1877-1956. Life and Building between Neckar and Bosporus" at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt am Main from January 21 to March 20, 2011 and at the Kunsthalle Tübingen from March 26 to May 22, 2011. - - The richly illustrated and annotated catalog presents Paul Bonatz, one of the influential architects and architecture teachers of the 20th century, who left a diverse work between modernity and tradition between the Empire and the early Federal Republic. He also made a name for himself as a designer of technical buildings. Like few other architects, he managed a fruitful dialogue with the engineers. - Bonatz was a liberal cosmopolitan, his relationship to National Socialism was accordingly reserved. Nevertheless, he sought state commissions in the 1930s, which he also received. Although he held a influential position as a bridge designer in the construction of the autobahns, he criticized Hitler's gigantism and emigrated to Turkey in 1944, where he worked as an architect and professor for ten years. His most important building, the Stuttgart main station (1911-1927), is acutely threatened in the framework of the large project "Stuttgart 21" - the two side wings will be sacrificed	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Social Exclusion through Inclusion : Imprisonment and Offender Support between Restriction and Resocialization ¤ The combination of increasingly harsh criminal policy and restrictive social policy, as it is currently staged, has a socially excluding character in its interaction for marginalized groups. In connection with the increasing poverty, social exclusion has become an important topic in recent years. A growing number of long-term unemployed, the precarious living conditions of migrants in the metropolises, the increasing poverty among young people, all this points to social situations that are marked by the term social exclusion. The logic of such social processes: The less competitive, the more socially vulnerable, the more lawless and the more economically and socially dispensable, the greater the danger of social exclusion of morally degraded persons or groups. A group that unites several of these characteristics is that of people who have become offenders.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122370-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033178-7>

Public Financial Flows and Spatial Development : [Scientific Plenary Session 2008] ¤ With the topic of "Public Financial Flows and Spatial Development", the Academy for Spatial Research and Land Planning (ARL) addresses questions whose far-reaching and lasting political significance is undisputed and whose current appearance is repeatedly brought to the forefront of public interest in changing forms. Spatial effects arise from all financial policy measures, including those that do not have an explicit spatial development policy reference. Nevertheless, the spatial implications of financial policy decisions are often not incorporated into political decision-making procedures and the spatial consequences of political decisions are not sufficiently systematically analyzed and evaluated. In this context, the present volume offers exemplary studies and regionalized analyses as well as theoretical considerations on the spatial effects of public funding and use in a broad spectrum of current economic and financial policy fields. With the publication, the ARL aims to promote the scientific and political discourse in the interface between spatial research and financial science and to intertwine both with each other.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017214-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314726-4>

Sustainability in Science: Leopoldina Workshop on November 12, 2012 in Berlin ¤ At the center of global considerations for addressing the central challenges of the 21st century is the concept of sustainability. In order for this principle to be reflected in concrete action proposals, it requires specification. The book therefore examines sustainability in science, the most important source of information for society. In this context, sustainability is considered both in terms of structures and activities in research and teaching. The topics treated are "the research of sustainability", which is intended to provide strategies for a better understanding, the complex "sustainably researching", which analyzes the prerequisites, courses, and consequences of research according to the criteria of sustainability, and "the sustainability of research", which examines the essential principles of science - such as the falsifiability of its results - in the light of the idea of sustainability. The focal points of the analysis are, in all areas, on the one hand, the tension between the freedom and sustainability of science, and on the other hand, the effects of the debate on the structures of the science system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066562-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8>

Cork : History, Architecture, Design 1750 - 2002 ; [for the special exhibition "Totally Corked?!" Cork: History, Architecture, Design 1750 - 2002 of the Museums of the City of Delmenhorst on the Nordwolle from 16.6. to 15.9.2002] ¤ For centuries, the renewing bark of the cork oak tree has provided valuable material for the production of bottle corks in countries around the Mediterranean. However, the commercial processing of cork has been located in the northwest of Germany, around and in the city of Delmenhorst, since the mid-18th century. Since then, the so-called "Proppensnieder" have mainly shipped cork stoppers to wine merchants all over the world. Cork has been and continues to be used in a wide variety of ways in architecture, design, and fashion: Cork has been used as a high-quality insulating material in building construction since ancient times; it is also highly sought after as a floor covering, either pure or as a main component of linoleum. Less well known is the fact that cork has been used for architectural model-making in Italy and Germany since the 18th century. It is also surprising that cork - alongside lacquer or leather - was used as a modern material in contemporary design in the 1920s, particularly in the avant-garde furniture design of Eileen Gray. The book deals with the cultural and social history of cork production and the cork industry, as well as the various uses of cork in architecture, design, and fashion of our time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079184-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233260-6>

Atem. Gestalterische, ökologische und soziale Dimensionen ¤ During breathing - in the process of constant exchange and crossing of boundaries between the organism and its environment - air as an «immaterial» material becomes active. For the first time, this anthology brings together studies on breath from the perspective of the arts and humanities, as well as experimental scientific and design practices. Focusing on the period from 1900 to the present day, the publication covers an era during which air has become a precarious medium: whether in the context of climate change or global pandemic, space technology or gas warfare, air is now co-created and manipulated by humans. Against this backdrop, breath appears as an elusive yet vital substance that reveals the interconnections between the physical, symbolic, technological and social realms	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003404-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157139-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055916-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130887-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043207-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201477-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112611-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Everyday and Transition Practices in Help for Young People : Between Self-Determination, Ingenuity and Societal Adaptation Demands ¤ Help for young people must be designed in such a way that they have a good chance at the end of the day of being able to live a self-determined life. What does everyday life in stationary aid institutions look like in order to achieve this goal? How can transitions be meaningfully designed? What social and legal policy decisions are necessary? In this volume, everyday and transitional practices in different help systems for young people are examined from different perspectives. This conference volume as a whole offers a variety of impulses for successful social pedagogical support for young people in transition situations on their way into adulthood.

Mythos Monument : urban strategies in architecture and art since 1945 ; [refers back to an international conference held in January 2010 at the Institute of Art History at the Ruhr University Bochum under the title "Mythos Monument. Urban strategies in architecture and art since 1945"] ¤ The reflection of the monumental is a central theme of architecture as well as art since 1945. On the one hand, this is evident in attempts to renew modern architecture through a new understanding of concepts. On the other hand, art has been shaped since the 1960s by the desire to comment on or deconstruct the monumental self-awareness of architecture. - - The book shows how architecture and art enter into a complex dialogue, which can be observed on different levels: from the immediate confrontation in the urban space to the conception of utopian places and anti-monuments, and down to the critical commentary on destroyed or reconstructed buildings and monuments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4619396-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4>
Quantitative Approaches in the Humanities : systematic and historical perspectives ¤ Since the beginning of the 19th century, quantitative methods have been applied in the humanities to describe, analyze, and interpret texts. Until the end of the 20th century, such approaches were underrepresented, but they have gained very strong importance in the context of Digital Humanities. The goal of the volume is to contextualize quantitative methods, on the one hand, theoretically, methodologically, and historically, and, on the other hand, to examine the significance of their results in the light of the digital present. In view of the innovative spirit of the Digital Humanities, it must not be forgotten that the idea of opposing a descriptive-analytical distant reading to an interpretative close reading is not much younger than the idea of close reading itself. For counting is by no means only conceivable through the 'digital revolution' of the humanities. Rather, what was determined by late Dilthey as the subject of the understanding and qualitatively oriented humanities has been explained as a 'measurable' object for about 200 years.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1154887952> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300400-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1038714850>
The New Century : European Time Diagnoses and Future Conceptions around 1900 ¤ This volume takes a look at the European-wide discussions and controversies around 1900. The contributions pay attention to the international dimension of these debates and focus on those fields of topics that contemporaries already gave special attention to and which were of prominent importance for the history of the 20th century. These included war and peace scenarios, scientific reasoning about a 'new man', perspectives on economy and technology, cultural and artistic determinations of location and future conceptions, expectations of a new gender order as well as the development of the industrial class society. These topics are illuminated from changing locations: from the perspective of social movements as well as from that of political classes, scientists or professional groups. 'Public opinion' of the turn of the century thus branches out into various actors and discussants. The book reconstructs a fascinating panoramic image of European public opinion - a panoramic image in which experiences of the past merge with expectations of the future, in which fears, distortions and omissions are just as suspended as hopes, longings and wishes.Ute Frevert is Professor of Social History at the University of Konstanz.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191125-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4253969-9>
Model Germany : [the 34th Annual Conference of the Society for German Studies e.V., simultaneously the Symposium of the German Society e.V. ...] ¤ German studies have long taken a historical and contemporary dimension, which, before 1989, critically viewed existing conditions and, with regard to the GDR, always adopted a system-transcendent perspective. It was right to 'hope' for one Germany before 1989. From an economic point of view, Germany has already overcome the consequences of the division. The conference addresses the question of whether Germany can be called a model in the European and even global context, 23 years after reunification. For every social scientist, it is clear that the distinction between East and West remains the central distinction category in all areas. German studies will increasingly serve as a platform for perspectives and approaches that focus on a Germany that still perceives the division, reflects the successful integration in current and further historical retrospect, and begins to assume the status of a model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288304-0>
Economic Buildings in the Ancient City: International Colloquium, November 16-17, 2012, Karlsruhe ¤ We are well informed about the economy of the ancient world. Buildings for the trade and money exchange were available in the cities, ranging from storage buildings in major economic centers and ports to bank and stock exchange buildings in the central squares of the cities. These buildings have been extensively studied by archaeologists and building historians, with building design and construction in the foreground. Economic historians have intensively dealt with trade and money transactions, without taking into account connections with buildings. Interdisciplinary cooperation opens up new perspectives. With the knowledge of economic processes, buildings can be better understood, and buildings can make economic processes visible. This became clear quickly during the first exchange of ideas between the different research disciplines. The present conference volume contains contributions on trade forms and trade relationships, it presents storage buildings and merchant houses and sheds light on the Magdalensberg in Carinthia, a major center of ore extraction and metal processing. A special place is taken by the Roman basilica as a great bank and stock exchange building, whose development began almost suddenly around 200 BC at the Roman Forum and with new standards also shaped the new power Rome as the center of the ancient economy and central authority of economic and tax law urbanistically. The two last contributions deal with the further development of the concept of basilica and its impact on church building and architectural theory to this day.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4360539-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004629-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
UK in View : Perspectives on Theories and Practice Fields in Supported Communication ¤ Supported Communication is no longer unthinkable in the everyday life of many people, regardless of the perspective from which one looks. The special and valuable thing about UK is precisely characterized by this multifacetedness: Different professions draw on different methods in unique ways in various life situations of those affected, in order to offer and promote additional or replacement forms of communication and thus meet the basic need for communication. The book brings together many different perspectives from which UK can be taken into view. Different methods are brought into view and different tools and approaches are taken under the magnifying glass.

The Media of Architecture : an Exhibition of the A:AI Archive for Architecture and Engineering Art in North Rhine-Westphalia ; [November 21 to December 7, 2007, Rudolf-Chaudoire-Pavillon, Campus South, Technical University of Dortmund] ¤ When one hears of architecture, one thinks first of all of buildings. Yet, despite being surrounded by buildings on a daily basis, buildings that concern us are rarely present in the immediate moment. They are mostly conveyed to us in various ways: through images, models, texts, and other forms of representation. While the physical existence of buildings cannot be denied, no building can come into being, be used, and be understood without media. This was the subject of an exhibition at the Faculty of Civil Engineering at TU Dortmund, which was prepared and held by students. The range of architectural representation was shown using selected items from the holdings of the A:AI Archive for Architecture and Engineering Art in North Rhine-Westphalia. Once not organized by building projects, but by media, sketches, plans, perspectives, detail drawings, static calculations, models, photos, films, texts, and publications were presented. In doing so, the question was primarily pursued of which specific properties different media have, and what these properties can say about the essence of architecture in turn	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8>
B1|A40 - the beauty of the big street : a project in the urban space of A40 from Duisburg to Dortmund, 06.12.2010 - 08.08.2010 ; Atelier van Lishout; Finger ...  ; [in conjunction with the exhibition "B1|A40 The beauty of the big street. A project in the urban space of A40 from Duisburg to Dortmund"] ¤ Through its daily closure in July, the A 40 highway became the largest media event in the European Capital of Culture RUHR.2010. The exhibition "B1 | A40 - The beauty of the big street" reflects how the A 40, in a unique reversal, becomes the central boulevard of the Ruhr metropolis with its over six million inhabitants, moving from the periphery to the center. Community gardens and shopping miles, cultural production and shadow economy - they all use the "big street" as a platform, node, infrastructure. This situation offers the opportunity to investigate pressing questions of the "Urban Age" on site: How are spaces generated beyond targeted planning and use interests? And what characterizes these - largely invisible to planning and politics - spaces? Artists, scientists, planners, and residents report on the conditions and opportunities of the new (city-) landscape and give valuable impulses for the current urban development discourse between art and planning	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172385-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4>
Exhausting Work : Health and Prevention in the Flexible Work World ¤ The new work world is characterized by increasing uncertainty. Discontinuous employment relationships are further on the advance. For employees in the knowledge economy, this is connected with higher degrees of freedom, but also new burdens - up to burnout. In addition, job nomads, freelancers, and temporary workers are often excluded from occupational health promotion. How and by whom can these groups be supported in health prevention? - The book illuminates these questions from various social scientific perspectives and underpins the argumentation with empirical findings.

Castles of Late Gothic in Central Germany : Conference Proceedings ; [from October 20 to 22, 2006, the symposium "Castles in the second half of the 15th century in Central Germany" ... took place at Sachsenburg Castle] ¤ Since 2002, investigations into the building history have been conducted at Sachsenburg Castle near Frankenberg/Sa. by the Sachsenburg Castle Foundation. The extremely significant findings obtained provided the occasion to hold a symposium on castle construction in the second half of the 15th century in Central Germany in 2006. This also made it possible to present the newly obtained research results in numerous other castles in Central Germany. This volume presents the contributions of the most renowned researchers in the field	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021656-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052753-0>
Monument and Energy 2017 : Energy Efficiency, Sustainability and User Comfort ¤ Contributions from renowned authors explain the opportunities and risks of energetic reinforcement of the building envelope and show successful energetic renovations under consideration of monument protection through practical examples. Furthermore, detailed considerations on fire protection and economic efficiency as well as the latest findings from research and development are presented. The connection between monument protection and energy efficiency poses a great challenge to current monument conservation. In the long term, historic buildings cannot escape the conflict between energy-saving measures and the preservation of original building substance. In the sense of sustainability, it is necessary to reduce the energy consumption and emissions of these buildings without significantly changing their appearance. However, only if a historic building meets a certain level of user comfort, it can also be used for future purposes and thus preserved. The content Buildings and Projects - Design and Construction - Material and Technology - Research and Development The target groups Architects, engineers, monument conservators, and representatives of the public service and companies active in the field of monument conservation and renovation. The editors Prof. Bernhard Weller is Director of the Institute for Building Construction at the Technical University of Dresden. Dipl.-Ing.

Terrorism as a Challenge to the European Union ¤ The fight against international terrorism has been a central focus of European security policy for over fifteen years. However, this raises the question of whether the large number of security measures and laws adopted at various political levels meet the required standards of effectiveness and proportionality. This volume offers a critical review of this policy area. In it, Raphael Bossong gives an overview of the strategic trends in EU anti-terrorism policy since 2015, while Oldrich Bures evaluates European measures to control so-called foreign fighters. Martin Kahl develops a fundamental critique of the effectiveness of the EU’s fight against terrorism. Tim Krieger and Daniel Meierrieks condense the economic debate on the cost and impact assessment of terrorism. Anja Jacobi and Janina Kandt analyse transnational governance to curb the financing of terrorism.

Hochschuldidaktische Qualifizierung : Strategies and Concepts in International Comparison ¤ The academic didactics qualification belongs today to the international standard. More and more countries, whose main resource is education, rely on the didactic qualification of their teaching staff. The book describes the international status quo: current country examples show the far-reaching changes in this area. In Germany, in particular, study programs, networks, and increasingly also modularized programs of academic didactics institutions take up an important place	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126457-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120509-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258104-7>
Artificial Intelligence, Democracy, and Privacy ¤ This volume contains selected papers from the 2021 annual conference affiliated to ‘Forum Privatheit’, which analyse the current challenges posed by the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to privacy, informational self-determination and democracy, and how they can be addressed through governance mechanisms. The contributions focus on the use of AI for profiling and surveillance purposes, on issues related to the dissemination and detection of disinformation through AI, and on the use of AI in the health and care sectors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6>
Environment and Empirical Social and Economic Research: Contributions and Discussion Reports from a Conference of the Project Group 'The Socio-Economic Panel' at the German Institute for Economic Research ¤ Environment and economic research and environmental protection are by no means only a subject of natural sciences, but empirical social and economic sciences and have an important place in this field of problems. The corresponding empirical research serves mainly two purposes: on the one hand, the representation (description) of the perception of the environmental status and its evaluation by the population and their subgroups. This branch of environmental social research stands in the tradition of social reporting. On the other hand, social and economic surveys serve the analysis of behavior, i.e., the investigation of the determinants of environmentally relevant behavior as well as the perception of the environment and its evaluation. -- The present volume provides an overview of environmentally oriented social and economic research in the first block. The second block contains essays that stand in the tradition of social reporting, while the third block presents investigations that micro-analytically examine environmental behavior	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202417-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078517-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4433832-6>
Digitization and the law ¤ New technologies mean new challenges for the law. The Internet is no longer a new land, critical issues such as cyber attacks, privacy, the protection of minors or cloud computing are not yet fully discussed. The increasing digitalization and technologization do not only concern the World Wide Web. Automated road traffic is a similarly forward-looking topic, whose development must be accompanied by law. In the present volume, research works by law scientists from Germany, the USA, Canada, and Greece are compiled. The series on Robotics and Law edited by Prof. Eric Hilgendorf and Prof. Susanne Beck deals with the discussion of practically relevant legal questions on robotics, technologization, and digitalization.

The Quran and its Religious and Cultural Environment ¤ In research, the Quran is often viewed as a self-sufficient text. The participants of the colloquium on the Quran, held at the Historical College in May 2006, freed themselves from this view. The contributions brought together in this volume testify to the diversity of approaches and methods used to study the Quran. They reflect the diversity of disciplines that deal with the Quran, from theology to Oriental studies and literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156614-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4680892-9>
Uncertainty Signatures of Technology: A New Interpretation of the Technified World ¤ Not that fundamental uncertainty has not always been a part of life or a more or less constant and universal condition of human existence, appears as a problem, but - that with the experience of an increase in uncertainty, technology is also affected and involved in the process of uncertainty; - that social freedom and option gains go hand in hand with lasting orientation losses; - that the technoscientific production of knowledge brings forth new zones of unknowing; - that we cannot know what we should actually do and - that dealing with this fact represents the starting condition for a time- and time-less philosophy of technology. The contributions of this volume (e.g. by Dreyfus, Dupuy, Hörning, Hubig, Nordmann and Willke) do not only follow the different aspects of this development. They also attempt to assess the socio-technical attempts at determination and clarification strategies, which in a radically modern world are always anew challenged by the task of 'self-determination in the uncertain' (Luhmann).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273405-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126976-7>
Believe against each other - research together? : Paradigm shift in early modern science cultures ¤ Den inhaltlich-thematischen Ausgangspunkt des Bandes bildet das sich verändernde Verhältnis von frühneuzeitlicher Astronomie und Physik zur christlichen Religion im Allgemeinen und zu ihren konfessionsspezifischen Ausprägungen im Besonderen. Vor diesem Hintergrund nehmen die versammelten Beiträge exemplarisch die entsprechenden, mit dem Wandel des Weltbildes verbundenen Prozesse anhand des zur Transkonfessionalität tendierenden Paradigmenwechsels in den frühneuzeitlichen Wissenschaftskulturen in den Blick. Dabei bieten die Welt, deren Bilder einen Wandel durchliefen, die Naturwissenschaften, die den Wandel vorantrieben, und die Theologien, die sich von einstigen Gewissheiten über Gott und Welt verabschiedeten, sich neu konstituierten und das Leben sowie die Naturforschung in der Frühen Neuzeit entscheidend mitbestimmten, eine dankbare Fläche für eine interkonfessionell vergleichende Untersuchung konfessioneller Spezifika.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048946-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041408-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003311-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136343-7>
Digital Transformation and Sustainability in the Global Financial Industry ¤ Despite some intensive discussions, there is still no conclusive nomenclature for the terms digital transformation and sustainability in the financial industry; their possible relationship has also remained largely unclear to date. However, there is general agreement that these terms and the changes behind them represent major challenges for companies and their stakeholders. This edited volume discusses the opportunities and risks arising from these two areas and their interplay, focusing in particular on both global finance and core financial aspects in companies.

Inquiring Women : Women Changing the Sciences ¤ The authors of this volume address the question of what significance women can achieve in the sciences. They exemplarily illuminate the life stories of contemporary women scientists such as Emmy Noether and Grace Murray Hopper. At the same time, they exercise science criticism in individual disciplines. They convey a current picture of the sciences and their institutions, in which women still have to contend with structural disadvantages. - Content: Ströker, Elisabeth: The role of women in the discovery of nuclear fission. - Tollmien, Cordula:	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136652-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244891-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8>
Social Media - New Masses : [... 2nd media scientific symposium of the German Research Foundation] ¤ At mass gatherings and the positive or negative phantasms of the mass, different discourses and practices of social control, communication, and community formation ignite. However, masses are no longer what they once were. From the replacement of mass media research by algorithmic evaluation of mass data to the diagnosis of scattered publics in the age of social media to new mass conceptions such as swarms, flash mobs, and multitudes: The emergence, functioning, and effects of digital masses are to be newly examined and negotiated. Furthermore, the changes of the present are an option to understand the culture and media history of the masses themselves anew. The book outlines this new field of research and brings together analyses of the difference between new and old masses, the different media-technical conditions, as well as the political consequences of current mass phenomena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037865-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043183-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227561-1>

What Models Can Do: A Small History of the Architectural Model in Contemporary Art; [on the occasion of the exhibition What Models Can Do. A Small History of the Architectural Model in Contemporary Art, June 29 - October 12, 2014, Museum of Contemporary Art Siegen] ¤ The three-dimensional architectural model – in a reduced scale – has been and is a tool for communication in the field of architecture and urban planning, for planned or realized architecture. The model can efficiently provide information about larger spatial relationships, which one perceives differently or not at all in original size. Because the model allows for the reduction of spatial complexity through miniaturization. Suddenly, one can see with a glance what can only be experienced in the temporal process of bodily explorations piece by piece in original size. It is striking that in contemporary art, the architectural and urban model is frequently taken up and freed from its narrowly defined functional context, so that its primary phenomenological qualities are adapted and made fruitful for artistic questions. In the conceptually understood contemporary art of the last 40 years, the architectural model is poetically opened and used in a metaphorical and theatrical way. Important in this context is also the mysterious aura of the small, as Gaston Bachelard describes it: So the gaze can penetrate – almost bodiless, yet always relying on and trusting the bodily experience. On the one hand, the obvious reference to the architectural model helps with the development and solution of sculptural questions, on the other hand, the architectural model – precisely in its state, which always remains a draft and is to be realized – can serve as an instrument of criticism and illustration of utopia. Just the both-and, the simultaneity of direct sensory presence and the suggestive distance to the experiential space of the viewers, makes one of the fascinations of the model. The exhibition and the book start the attempt to write a small history of the architectural model in contemporary art. This should begin with the legendary – monumental – models of Charles Simonds and Anne and Patrick Poirier, with Ludger Gerdes, Hermann Pitz and Thomas Schütte to brush the 1990s and continue the thread to the current positions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128638-8>

The Color White : Color Frenzy and Color Abstinence in Architecture ; [as Catalog for the Exhibition "The Color White - Color Frenzy and Color Abstinence in Architecture", April 27 - June 22, 2003, Ulm City Hall] ¤ Ten years after the completion of the city hall, the building itself was the focus of an exhibition, designed by Richard Meier. At the center was a characteristic of Meier's architecture, the emphatically presented white. With this white, Meier linked to the architecture of modernity around 1930. Here, white was associated with sobriety and clarity. It stood for the liberation from the shackles of history, from the pathos of the (colored) founder's era, which was felt to be outdated. - - At least since the early Renaissance, color has been used programmatically in architecture. The exhibition documented the change in attitudes through selected graphics, paintings, and architectural models, with the 19th and 20th centuries at the center. Works by Gottfried Semper, Jakob I. Hittorff, Giovanni Salucci, Friedrich von Gärtner, as well as Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, and Hermann Finsterlin were on display. The final point was made by works of contemporary architects like Sauerbruch Hutton, Otto Steidle, and Günther Behnisch, whose emphasized colorfulness contrasted with Richard Meier's white. - - The works on display were in and on colorful volumetric cubes, which, on the one hand, maintained a respectful distance from the walls of the city hall, and on the other hand, allowed the exhibition of light-sensitive graphics in their interior. The walls of the main exhibit, Richard Meier's architecture, were not touched by the exhibition, except for some programmatic quotes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153709-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189483-2>
Resilience as a Success Factor in Tourism: Contributions from Science and Practice for the Development of Destinations ¤ This is an Open-Access book. Resilience is today one of the central future themes in tourism. Under the conditions of persistent crisis situations and rapid change processes, questions of resistance and adaptability are increasingly being brought to the forefront. What distinguishes more resilient destinations and tourist actors in more detail and how the necessary transformation of the industry succeeds, is investigated in this innovative volume. In addition to current practical insights from different regions, relevant topics are treated, such as: - the role of diversity, - resilience in destination management, - the importance of citizen participation, - the consideration of the perceptions of the local population, as well as - resilience in wine and hiking tourism. A fascinating impulse giver to a key theme of the tourism industry, which emerged in the framework of the „5th Deidesheimer Conversations on Tourism Science“.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4817917-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4466880-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1024713873>

In the early bourgeois era, roughly until the last quarter of the 19th century, the division and use of urban land was subject to a bitter competition between private landowners and increasingly also commercial land and construction companies. Between state and municipal institutions and private owners of land and property, new areas of responsibility, techniques, and design principles emerged.

When Dignity Becomes Commodity: Social Inequality, Participation, and Realization of a Right to Housing; [... Federal Congress of the Protestant Homeless Aid, which took place from November 17 to 19, 2012 in Nuremberg with the title "Housing is good - everything is good?".] ¤ In this volume, the difficulties of access to the general housing market for people are shown. This has no interest in housing provision for all on its own and is subject to other laws. Having to live without a home means not only being deprived of fundamental rights, but also having to defend oneself against various prejudices. The excluded often have different cultural backgrounds or have to struggle with psychological difficulties. Different models of accompanying counseling for stabilizing living conditions are presented, as well as cooperation forms with neighboring fields of work in homeless aid.

Martin Elsaesser and the New Frankfurt : [within the framework of "Phenomen Expressionism 2009 - 2011 - a project of the Cultural Fund FrankfurtRheinMain" ; on the occasion of the exhibition "Martin Elsaesser and the New Frankfurt" (October 10, 2009 - March 14, 2010), organized by the German Architecture Museum, Department of Culture and Science, City of Frankfurt am Main] ¤ The accompanying book to the exhibition at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt am Main from October 10, 2009 to January 31, 2010. - - The publication assumes a dual role: it accompanies an exhibition and documents in detail realized and project-based buildings of the architect during his time as artistic director of the building authority in Frankfurt between 1925 and 1932. Furthermore, it deepens aspects such as Elsaesser's difficult role as a key co-designer of the New Frankfurt as well as the economic, political, and personal conditions of his tenure. The book also approaches the teacher and (family) person Elsaesser and undertakes excursions into other creative phases of the building artist, who has left a rich work before and a few, but outstanding, buildings after the Frankfurt phase. The analysis of his writings reflects the design understanding of a practitioner and theorist who understood himself as a mediator between tradition and modernity. In addition, the most comprehensive work catalog of his (re-)buildings and designs for Frankfurt between 1925 and 1954 is added.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Altar Space as Community Space: Renovation of Existing Churches; [a symposium held at the Catholic Theological Private University of Linz in May 2003] ¤ The renovation of existing churches, in particular altar space designs, have - following the boom of new buildings from the post-war period to the 1980s - become the most frequent undertaking of ecclesiastical building activity. Despite new insights into historical spatial situations and new liturgical-theological considerations, the ever new challenge for the communities remains to implement theological fundamental insights and pastoral requirements appropriately into a spatial design.

Information Age Economy : 5th International Conference on Business Informatics 2001 ¤ The use of information and (tele-)communication systems for business has become an ubiquitous phenomenon due to the rapid technological progress at the beginning of the 3rd millennium. Under keywords such as e(lectronic)-, m(obile)-, u(biquitous)-Computing/Commerce, today's visions of the future are discussed, which assign a central role to information and communication systems far beyond their current purposes on the way to electronic service economy. This book considers this development in all its facets and presents pioneering research and practice works at the interface of modern business administration, business informatics, and applied computer science. It bridges the gap between science and practice by showing the essential design options and recommendations that pave the way for businesses to successfully enter the "Information Age Economy"	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114011-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120906-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4592128-3>
Variants of Change : the Region in Recent History 1970-2020 ¤ It may be surprising that 'great processes' like globalization or digitalization have brought the region back into the focus of historical interest. However, it was here that social changes 'after the boom' were actually most evident. In view of the transformative quality of these years, research now distinguishes winners and losers and refers to significant regional differences. The authors of the volume take this as an opportunity to examine a series of different regional fields of study in more detail and to work out special 'variants of change' since 1970. It shows that acute action requirements below the national level were often recognized early on and that the social groups and actors on site proved to be the actual shapers of change. The regions were, however, affected to varying degrees due to their respective dispositions and potentials and therefore followed in many cases very specific development paths.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6>

Instrumentarium of Spatial Planning and State Planning for Raw Materials Security in the States of Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein ¤ The state of implementation of raw materials security in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, from state and regional planning to the municipal level, is considered from a geological-economic and planning perspective. Weaknesses in raw materials economic demand analysis as well as in the planning implementation of the respective area allocations (priority, precaution, and reservation areas) are shown. The existing instrumentarium of state planning is sufficient. However, awareness of what binding planning provisions are and where scope for discretion lies is not sufficiently developed. Trustworthy cooperation of all parties involved in raw materials security is required in order to do justice to both nature and environmental protection and the supply of the economy with the necessary mineral raw materials.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124074-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034268-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0>

Digital Transformation of the Public Sphere: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Political Participation in Flux ¤ Widely discussed phenomena like ‘filter bubbles’ and ‘social bots’ point to the reality that the digital transformations of the present also encompass public communication. New opportunities for information and participation have arisen and opinion formation is changing. This volume explores these transformations from an ethical perspective and discusses theoretical work in theology, media ethics and political science in combination with digital practice. It evaluates the potential knowledge arising from various concepts and functions in the ‘public sphere’ under the conditions of digital societies, and discusses in a nuanced way both the dangers to democracy and the opportunities for civic participation and bottom-up processes as a result of digital transformation. Venturing beyond institutional politics, this volume explores the digital transformation of the political and its consequences for churches, protest movements and media outlets.Hence, the contributions it contains are not only relevant for academics working on digital transformation, but also journalists, politicians and employees at NGOs and in churches.With contributions bySigrid Baringhorst, Christina Schachtner, Florian Stickel, Julian Zeyher-Quattlender, Gary Schaal, Ilona Nord, Christoph Bieber, Jonas Bedford-Strohm, Alexander Filipovic, Alexander Görlach, Torsten Meireis, Frederike van Oorschot, Thomas Renkert.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043183-6>

The Modulor : Mass and Proportion : LeCorbusier Pavilion ¤ The Modulor is perhaps Le Corbusier's most famous invention. Developed from examples in nature and art history, this last major proportion system combines the human scale with the Golden Section. From 1945, the Modulor becomes the basis for spectacular designs by Le Corbusier in graphic design, architecture, and urban planning, and ultimately a symbol of his universal achievement. This publication illustrates his passionate research, shows examples, references, and well-known applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238270-1>
Current Tasks for State and Regional Planning in Bavaria: 23rd Seminar for State and Regional Planners in Bavaria ¤ The 23rd Seminar for State and Regional Planners in Bavaria deals with various aspects that have become increasingly important for planning and will continue to grow. The first keyword is Europe, whose further integration must also affect state and regional planning. Especially at the regional level, it is challenges such as large retail projects or wind energy use and finally social change, which require more cooperation and collaboration at the regional level. In this context, new 'soft' planning instruments play an important role on the one hand, and changes in communication networks based on modern IuK technology on the other hand. The book provides a snapshot of the current discussion on the tasks and solution paths of current state and regional planning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034268-2>

Rethinking Aging : Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Demographic Change ¤ Declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy are observable phenomena in highly developed industrial societies worldwide, which are discussed in a contradictory manner in politics, media, and science: On the one hand, a crisis rhetoric warns of a 'shrinking', 'aging' society or a 'pensioner democracy' and thus puts the intergenerational conflict at the center. On the other hand, an ideal of aging is propagated that declares activity, self-responsibility, and the willingness for 'lifelong learning' to be desirable and thus directly joins the discourse of the New Economy. This volume claims to counteract the ideological 'demographicization' of social problems and to show possibilities of how aging is not only to be thought anew, but also how a self-determined and dignified life (until death) can be designed. To this end, current (and historical) discourses on demographic change and the culture of aging are critically examined from interdisciplinary perspectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124541-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001446-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034863-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195112-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226550-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071781-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117672-8>
Historical Facade Plasters : Conservation and Reconstruction ; 3rd Workshop of the Institute for Building Chemistry Leipzig e.V., Kloster Nimbschen, June 16 and 17, 2000 ¤ The conservation and reconstruction of historical facade plasters is an interesting and challenging task of monument conservation. The book summarizes the lectures of a workshop that deals with all aspects of this problem. Procedures for the analysis of the material composition and layer structure of historical exterior plasters, as well as the material bond, the interaction with the substrate, and the quality of old plasters with regard to their functions as a design element and protective layer of the building against environmental influences are described. Thus, the question of whether conservation is worthwhile or removal and replacement can be competently answered. Techniques for the conservation of historical plaster surfaces and the proper reconstruction with modern products are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263574-3>
The Development of Transportation in Schleswig-Holstein 1750 - 1918 ¤ The 12 research contributions of this collective volume are the result of a community project pursued since 1988 in the Working Group for Economic and Social History of Schleswig-Holstein, to which the "Atlas of the Transportation History of Schleswig-Holstein in the 19th Century" is also owed. The introductory essay by the editor W. Asmus sets the framework: modern transportation began to develop in the 18th century and is treated here until the 1st World War. Until around 1830, shipping had the greatest importance in Schleswig-Holstein, with which half of the contributions are concerned. Two investigations deal with local transportation structures (Flensburg, Lübeck), one with the development of the railway network and one with the expansion of a rural road network (Elbmarschen); the final essay outlines the Lower Saxon transportation history of the 18th and 19th centuries. Scientific, but generally understandable treatment of an important part of regional history. (I. Hanewald)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062901-6>
Palatium Sacrum : Sacredness at the Court of the Middle Ages : Places, Things, Rituals ¤ Cross-section of current research on the religious culture of the medieval court. Fundamental studies on a hitherto neglected aspect of pre-modern residence research in a perspective extending beyond Europe. 'The volume brings together 17 contributions from an international conference held at the University of Göttingen from June 18-20, 2015. It raises the question of the forms of appearance and practices of the sacred at courts of the pre-modern era, whether in buildings, objects, or rituals. At the center of a cross-cultural discourse is the post-antique palace with its religious places and zones, but also other forms of cultic tabooing and sanctification, in which the boundary between 'profane' and 'sacred' is often difficult to determine. The time frame ranges from antiquity to the late Middle Ages, the cultural spectrum from Western Europe and Byzantium to the Islamic courts in Syria and Al-Andalus.'	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4500752-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122200-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129695-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025453-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205979-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159400-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024600-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178936-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050164-4>
Finland : Architecture in the 20th Century ; [in conjunction with the exhibition of the same name at the exhibition center of the Vienna Municipal General Insurance Company AG in Vienna, exhibition period: 6. 12. 2000 - 19. 1. 2001] ¤ Finnish architecture enjoyed a broad international interest throughout the 20th century. Notable highlights were the national romanticism of the early years of the century, as architecture together with other cultural fields supported the efforts for national independence (1917); further the dynamic functionalism of the 1930s, which embodied the young independent nation through modern, functionalist buildings; in the 1950s the renewed modernism received an independent interpretation, which relied on Finnish topography and climatic conditions and developed into an international model. The end of the 1990s brought, as shown by the interest of international media, critics, and historians, another highlight of Finnish architecture. In addition to the well-known masters such as Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto, the book presents the diversity of Finnish architecture from Art Nouveau to the present. The Ringturm series is an ambitious project that receives high international attention. It is supported by the Vienna Municipal General Insurance Company and already comprises 10 volumes. In cooperation with the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki, the contributions of the authors, particularly Finnish authors, provide profound information, detailed background or insider knowledge, and no less important, diverse insights into a piece of Europe that has a decidedly exciting, almost thriving building world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Flächennutzungsmonitoring IV : more accurate data - informed actors - practical action ; [... contributions of the 4th Dresden land use symposium, which took place from 14 to 15 June 2012 ...] ¤ The topics of land use development and reliable land use monitoring, taking into account the goals of sustainable land management policy, are gaining greater importance for politics, spatial planning, and environmental protection in the face of increasing land competition and ambitious land-saving targets. In the meantime, an intensive expert discussion has begun on how and on what data basis the land take-up of settlement and traffic can be measured, how qualitative aspects of land use can be included in addition to official land surveys, what role high-resolution topographic geospatial data and building data play, how land development potentials can be recorded, and how corresponding analysis results can be visually and understandably presented. The present book publication brings together current contributions from science and practice in this context. Answers are given to questions about land survey methods, remote sensing land monitoring, indicator-based description of selected aspects of land use structure, use of geospatial data, building surveys and stock analyses, small-scale data offerings and analysis procedures for settlement structure, and land development prognosis. This volume brings together the contributions of the 4th Dresden land use symposium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314726-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017396-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134175-2>
Cities for All ¤ In honor of the two city directors Martin Neuffer and Rudolf Koldewey of the state capital Hanover, the symposium took place in June 2005. The visionary ideas and development possibilities of Martin Neuffer ("Cities for All - Draft of a City Policy" as a programmatic title of one of his books) and the rather sober and pragmatic thinking and acting of Rudolf Koldewey formed the intellectual field of tension in which the individual contributions of this documentation are located. As a result, the current challenges to urban planning and urban development are clearly shown against the background of partly far-reaching changes in the urban development policy framework from the perspective of local politics, urban research, planning administration, and administrative modernization.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
Dokumentation als seelsorgliche Aufgabe : electronic patient files in the context of Spiritual Care ¤ In clinical pastoral care, it has become common practice for pastoral caregivers to digitally document their work, make it accessible to various professions, and retain it for different purposes. But what are the possibilities and limitations of such documentation? In the German-speaking region, this topic is being researched and extensively discussed for the first time as part of a National Fund project: Basic considerations are supplemented by practical-theological, ethical, and legal perspectives, as well as those from concrete medical and nursing practice. Not least, it is about practical-theological questions: How do you handle the pastoral secret when it is to be documented interprofessionally? Which concrete documentation practices are developing? Many questions related to this complex and new topic, such as data protection, are dealt with in detail.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073773-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054151-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032832-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078249-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1070361356> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012656-0>

Fülle des Schönen : Harz Garden Landscape ; [in conjunction with the special exhibition of Schloß Wernigerode GmbH ; Spring construction Schloß Wernigerode, 12 September 2002 - 2 February 2003] ¤ The spectrum of the book ranges from the medieval cloister garden to the mannerist garden of the late Renaissance, the formal Baroque park, the sentimental landscape garden, the classical English landscape park, the 19th-century spa park, to the Art Nouveau garden and the garden in the architectural tradition of early 20th-century. - 40 exemplary park and garden facilities are presented in detail. They are scattered throughout the entire Harz area and have been selected according to their historical significance. Thus, a horticultural overview of the multifaceted cultural region around the mythical Brocken was created for the first time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144384-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073981-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044673-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125179-9>
Crisis of the Future II : Responsibility and Freedom in the Face of Apocalyptic Scenarios ¤ Current debates on self-understanding in Western societies are characterized by crisis discourses that often draw on religious-apocalyptic symbolism. The future, it seems, can only be thought of in the mode of the catastrophic, at least in European discourses. Such a way of thinking about the future has an impact on current action and challenges our traditional ethical concepts. Who can still take responsibility for the future if the catastrophe seems unavoidable? This volume brings together the contributions of the interdisciplinary final conference of the Research College 'The Crisis of the Future' of the Center for Religion, Economy and Politics (ZRWP) Basel. The texts deal with the questions that current forms of future discursivization bring with them from an ethical perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025493-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191125-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191123-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069996-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078249-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034864-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062547-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002431-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065464-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015508-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152203-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315469-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027274-6>

From Hand Measurement to High Tech : measuring, modeling, representing ; recording methods in historical building research ; interdisciplinary colloquium from February 23 - 26, 2000 ¤ From Hand Measurement to High Tech - in this field of tension, the current discussion about methods and procedures of building recording in building research, archaeology, and monument conservation is moving. Latest survey procedures, 3D models or virtual reality offer new opportunities for measuring and presenting buildings, ruin fields or entire urban structures. At the same time, many objects require an intensive study on site, which can only be realized with the traditional methods of hand measurement. - In over 30 contributions, in which the interdisciplinary discussion of a colloquium held at the Technical University of Cottbus is summarized, the potential and limitations of the different procedures are presented in a tangible way. The book contains 38 contributions of a colloquium at the University of Cottbus. The new technical possibilities of measurement through computer programs, 3-D representations and many other new methods have also strongly influenced the measurement and building recording in the archaeological field, in building design and in monument conservation. The book answers many questions on the subject, explains the current state of development and the applied practical methods.

Silk in the Early and High Medieval Women's Convent: Possession - Significance - Reuse; [Eleventh Meeting of the Essen Working Group for the Research of Women's Convents and the Catholic Academy 'The Wolfsburg' from 2 to 4 November 2012] ¤ Valuable silks from Byzantium and Central Asia were exclusive goods, comparable to gold, precious stones, and gems or cameos. In the Early and High Middle Ages, the expensive silk fabrics generally only arrived in the West as gifts and were often further given away due to their value. On this way, the valuable goods also found their way from worldly possession into the disposal of religious communities. On the Mathilden-Otto-Cross, the Essen abbess Mathilde wears an expensive garment. What kind of fabric is it, where does it come from, what message is to be conveyed to the viewers with the garment? The ways of such textiles to Essen raise questions about the political and cultural relationships of the community. A second aspect is the reuse of the valuable silks in the Middle Ages. Such silks also arrived in Essen, which were reused by packing mainly relics into them. These small silken objects are partly of extraordinary quality and have been researched in recent years	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180732-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163208-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059624-2>
Leisure Mobility - Developments and Options for Action: Documentation of a Seminar of the German Institute for Urbanistics on October 8 and 9, 1997 in Berlin ¤ Sowohl bei der Forschung als auch bei den Zuständigen in den Kommunen wird dem Freizeitverkehr bislang nicht die ihm gebührende Beachtung geschenkt, obwohl er in den zurückliegenden Jahren erheblich zugenommen hat. Dafür sorgen die Rahmenbedingungen wie die Ausweitung des Zeitbudgets der Bevölkerung und die Sogwirkung sich vermehrender Freizeiteinrichtungen im Umland der Städte. In der Freizeit mobil zu sein, bedeutet bislang hauptsächlich im Automobil unterwegs zu sein. Die dadurch entstehenden Verkehrsmengen signalisieren deutlich Handlungsbedarf. Vor diesem Hintergrund veranstaltete das Deutsche Institut für Urbanistik ein Seminar zum Thema Freizeitmobilität. Die inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte der Vorträge suchten Antworten auf zwei zentrale Fragen: Welche Entwicklungen im Freizeitverkehr haben stattgefunden oder sind künftig zu erwarten, und welche Ursachen sind dafür maßgeblich? Welche Handlungsmöglichkeiten gibt es, um zumindst eine "relative Bändigung" der Freizeitgestaltung mit dem Auto zu erreichen? Die Veröffentlichung enthält die schriftlichen Fassungen der Vorträge.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018398-1>

Quanten / ed. by Konrad Kleinknecht ; [1]: Quanten [1] ¤ The Heisenberg Society, founded in December 2012, is dedicated to the dissemination of the intellectual legacy of Werner Heisenberg, who is counted among the most important scientists of the 20th century. With his quantum mechanics, he opened up to us the world of the smallest building blocks of matter, atoms, atomic nuclei, and elementary particles. His discovery of the uncertainty relation has far-reaching consequences for the philosophy of nature and the theory of knowledge and enables secure encryption of information. The society publishes the lectures of the annual general meeting on scientific and philosophical questions related to Heisenberg's work in book form, with the first volume, 'Quanten', now available.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266670-3>

Contraction and Rebuilding : Perspectives on Regional and Destination Development ¤ It is becoming increasingly clear that widespread growth is not possible: booming centers cannot exist without their counterparts – growth and decline are two sides of the same coin, they only exist together and alongside each other. What we therefore need is a debate on strategies for spaces whose future looks unfavorable in economic or social terms. The present volume deals with contraction and rebuilding primarily as part of a development and less as the opposite of growth. The scientific and practice-related contributions are intended to contribute to a sensitization to these spatial developments. If we understand withdrawal and rebuilding as an opportunity, we can reposition affected areas as living and experience spaces, and peripheral spaces can regain their attractiveness. The book is a plea to actively shape exit or contraction processes in order to be able to tackle the challenges and problems of such spaces in a targeted manner. Biographical note: Elisa Innerhofer is Senior Researcher at the Institute for Regional Development at the European Academy Bozen and active in the hotel industry. She earned her doctorate in economics at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. Her research interests include destination and regional development as well as the creative economy.

Weapons and dangerous tools as aggravating circumstances : Comparative law and reform ¤ Since the 6th Criminal Code Reform Act 1998, there have been aggravating circumstances in the German Criminal Code for carrying a „dangerous tool“. Attempts to explain the concept of a dangerous tool in a sufficiently precise manner are considered to have failed. However, there are hardly any considerations as to how the BGH's suggested „adequate rewording of the law“ could be implemented. With the goal of a sensible revision, the regulatory models in nine countries were compared. The comparison is framed by a historical representation of theft with weapons. The comparative cross-section summarizes the solution models analytically and evaluates them. Reform considerations conclude the collection. The editor is the holder of the Chair of Criminal Law, in particular European Criminal Law and International Criminal Law, at the Europa-Universität Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder) with a research focus on comparative criminal law.

The Consumer City : Consumers in the Medieval City ¤ For modern urban history research, the reappropriation of Max Weber's considerations on the type of occidental city has proven to be particularly inspiring. Less present in the debates of the time around 1900, however, is the fact that the economic aspect of the concept of the city was of considerable importance. This connection is readable in Max Weber's work. It is even more evident in Werner Sombart's formulation, who assigns the consumer a central role in the emergence and development of cities, in contrast to producers and merchants. The present collection examines the productivity of historical concepts of consumption and relates them to current problem contexts of medieval urban history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078777-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129108-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020517-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0>
To be seen : queer lives 1900-1950 ¤ The contributions in this volume present the history of queer life designs - from the first emancipation movements at the turn of the century to self-empowerment attempts in the Weimar Republic to the destruction of queer subcultures under the Nazi regime and the continued discrimination of LGBTIQ people in the post-war period. Since the late 19th century, more and more people have boldly advocated for the recognition of queer ways of life. These pioneers formed collectives, gained a hearing, and challenged dominant gender categories politically, scientifically, and artistically. In the form of essays, interviews, and artworks, authors and artists illuminate this struggle for recognition, which was violently suppressed, destroyed, and barely remembered after 1945.

Transgenerational Transmission of War-Traumatized Childhoods: Interdisciplinary Studies on the Sustainability of Historical Experiences Across Four Generations ¤ For the first time, the transgenerational context of war-affected childhoods is systematically examined in combination with contemporary history, psychosomatics/psychoanalysis, and child and adolescent psychotherapy and psychiatry. Current historical research sees the causes of the Second World War in connection with the First World War and its effects. Such a perspective is also suitable for the research of war-affected children. For the first time, the transgenerational context of war-affected childhoods is systematically examined in combination with contemporary history, psychosomatics/psychoanalysis, and child and adolescent psychotherapy and psychiatry. Current historical research sees the causes of the Second World War in connection with the First World War and its effects. Such a perspective is also suitable for the research of war-affected children. The contributions clearly and sustainably clarified our current limited state of knowledge and the resulting research desiderata. It is clear that from the first war-affected generation (of the First World War) to the grandchildren of the war children of the Second World War as the fourth generation, transgenerational effects can be observed, which are based on a combination of guiding images, educational norms, burdening, damaging, and traumatizing experiences, and neurotic (family) structures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509413-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156601-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225195-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165693-3>

Nonlinear modeling of economic and financial time-series ¤ Within the subprime crisis (2007) and the recent global financial crisis of 2008-2009, we have observed significant decline, corrections and structural changes in most US and European financial markets. Furthermore, it seems that this crisis has been rapidly transmitted toward the most developed and emerging countries and has strongly affected the whole economy. This volume aims to present recent researches in linear and nonlinear modelling of economic and financial time-series. The several discussions of empirical results of its chapters clearly help to improve the understanding of the financial mechanisms inherent to this crisis. They also yield an important overview on the sources of the financial crisis and its main economic and financial consequences. The book provides the audience a comprehensive understanding of financial and economic dynamics in various aspects using modern financial econometric methods. It addresses the empirical techniques needed by economic agents to analyze the dynamics of these markets and illustrates how they can be applied to the actual data. It also presents and discusses new research findings and their implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1>

Ziegenhagel: Dispersion Properties of the Partition of Unity Method & Explicit Dynamics Meshfree methods, particle methods, and generalized finite element methods have witnessed substantial development since the mid 1990s. The growing interest in these methods is due in part to the fact that they are extremely flexible numerical tools and can be interpreted in a number of ways. For instance, meshfree methods can be viewed as a natural extension of classical finite element and finite difference methods to scattered node configurations with no fixed connectivity. Furthermore, meshfree methods offer a number of advantageous features which are especially attractive when dealing with multiscale phenomena: a priori knowledge about particular local behavior of the solution can easily be introduced in the meshfree approximation space, and coarse-scale approximations can be seamlessly refined with fine-scale information. This volume collects selected papers presented at the Seventh International Workshop on Meshfree Methods, held in Bonn, Germany in September 2013.

Sparse Grids and Applications ¤ In the recent decade, there has been a growing interest in the numerical treatment of high-dimensional problems. It is well known that classical numerical discretization schemes fail in more than three or four dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. The technique of sparse grids helps overcome this problem to some extent under suitable regularity assumptions. This discretization approach is obtained from a multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction and subsequent truncation of the resulting multiresolution series expansion. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the workshop on sparse grids and its applications held in Bonn in May 2011. The selected articles present recent advances in the mathematical understanding and analysis of sparse grid discretization. Aspects arising from applications are given particular attention.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4411841-7>

Nonlinear Waves in Real Fluids ¤ The study of materials which exhibit new and unconventional properties is of central importance for the development of advanced and refined technologies in many fields of engineering science. In this connection there has been a rapidly growing interest in real fluid effects on wave phenomena in the past few years. A prominent example is provided by Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluids which have the distinguishing feature that they exhibit negative nonlinearity over a finite range of temperature and pressures in the pure vapour phase. However, two phase flows with and without phase change are an even richer source of new unexpected and previously thought impossible phenomena. Topics covered by this volume include waves in gases near the critical point, waves in retrograde fluids, temperature waves in superfluid helium and density waves in suspensions of particles in liquids. Clearly, the aim of the various contributions is twofold. First, they are intended to provide scientists and engineers working in these and related areas with an overview of various new physical phenomena as for example expansion shocks, sonic shocks, shock splitting, evaporation and liquafaction shocks and the experimental techniques needed to study these phenomena. Second, an attempt is made to discuss aspects of their mathematical modeling with special emphasis on properties which these phenomena have in common	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042102-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3>

Cars, conduits, and kampongs : the modernization of the Indonesian city, 1920 - 1960 ¤ Cars, Conduits and Kampongs offers a wide panorama of the modernization of the cities in Indonesia between 1920 and 1960. The contributions present a case for asserting that Indonesian cities were not merely the backdrop to processes of modernization and rising nationalism, but formed a causal factor. Modernization, urbanization, and decolonization were intrinsically linked. The various chapters deal with such innovations as the provision of medical treatments, fresh water and sanitation, the implementation of town planning and housing designs, and policies for coping with increased motorized traffic and industrialization. The contributors share a broad critique of the economic and political dimensions of colonialism, but remain alert to the agency of colonial subjects who respond, often critically, to a European modernity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120755-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070860-3>

Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841, the drama of architecture : [in conjunction with the exhibition "Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841: the Drama of Architecture", organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and presented October 29, 1994, through January 2, 1995] ¤ Neoclassicism’s most prominent exponent in Prussia, Karl Friedrich Schinkel is revered today for his reshaping of Berlin as Prussia’s capital, and for catalyzing the Greek Revival in Germany. Most of Berlin’s most famous Neoclassical structures are his doing--the Neue Wache, the Schauspielhaus, the Gendarmenmarkt and the Altes Museum, for example. His Bauakademie of 1836 is even considered by many to foreshadow the austerity and clean lines of German Modernist architecture. But Schinkel is equally revered for his legacy of architectural drawing and unbuilt works, gathered (from the Schinkel archives) herein, making this book the definitive Schinkel primer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Appreciating physical landscapes: three hundred years of geotourism ¤ Geotourism, as a form of sustainable geoheritage tourism, was defined and developed, from the early 1990s, to contextualize modern approaches to geoconservation and physical landscape management. However, its roots lie in the late seventeenth century and the emergence of the Grand Tour and its domestic equivalents in the eighteenth century. Its participants and numerous later travellers and tourists, including geologists and artists, purposefully explored wild landscapes as 'geotourists'. The written and visual records of their observations underpin the majority of papers within this volume; these papers explore some significant geo-historical themes, organizations, individuals and locations across three centuries, opening with seventeenth century elite travellers and closing with modern landscape tourists. Other papers examine the resources available to those geotourists and explore the geotourism paradigm. The volume will be of particular interest to Earth scientists, historians of science, tourism specialists and general readers with an interest in landscape history	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7543763-6>

This volume is an important contribution to the conceptualization of the largest empire of Late Antiquity. While previous studies used Iraq as the paradigm for the entire empire, this volume looks at diverse regions instead. After a theoretical introduction to the concept of 'elites' in an early Islamic context, the papers focus on elite structures and networks within selected regions of the Empire (Transoxiana, Khurāsān, Armenia, Fārs, Iraq, al-Jazīra, Syria, Egypt, and Ifrīqiya). The papers analyze elite groups across social, religious, geographical, and professional boundaries. Although each region appears unique at first glance, based on their heterogeneous surviving sources, its physical geography, and its indigenous population and elites, the studies show that they shared certain patterns of governance and interaction, and that this was an important factor for the success of the largest empire of Late Antiquity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014457-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4359141-3>

Take it sporty – Planning as an obstacle course : 16th Young Forum of the ARL, May 29 to 31, 2013 in Kaiserslautern ¤ Spatial planning has a challenging mandate of design and coordination. Herewith, the tasks of planners and the demands made on planning are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Planners are thus repeatedly confronted with boundaries and barriers, often reaching the limits of their ability to act. However, such limits are seldom final; they represent rather transitions to new situations. It is a matter of discovering how to overcome the existing boundaries and barriers of (or in) the various dimensions and fields of planning. Often the challenge for planners here is to leave behind what is familiar and to break new ground. This volume seeks answers to the questions of how planning can remain capable of effective action, what would have to change to ensure this, and how planning can perhaps even take advantage of boundaries and barriers. The meeting of the ARL Junges Forum from 29 to 31 Mai 2013 in Kaiserslautern discussed these topics. The focus was on the following questions: How can new avenues be explored in planning? What needs to change, and how can planning actually take advantage of existing boundaries and barriers?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034354-6>

Rethinking economics : markets, technology, and economic evolution ¤ Rethinking Economics is a major contribution to the reconstruction of an economic theory appropriate to the 21st century. Just as major changes are occurring in the world economy, economics itself is on the brink of change. Orthodox economics is now widely criticized for its sterility and its limited applicability to real-world economic problems. Standard theoretical tools such as general equilibrium theory are now regarded, even by their leading practitioners, as highly limited and problematic. New ideas from chaos theory, evolutionary modelling and institutional theory point to new, non-reductionist approaches in which there are units of analysis other than the atomistic individual. This work addresses core economic concepts, such as individual choice, prices, markets, production, industries, technology, innovation and economic growth in the light of these developments. This unique, up-to-date volume makes a seminal contribution at the frontiers of economic theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232912-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071051-8>

This book deals with randomly moving objects and their spreading. The objects considered are particles like atoms and molecules, just as living beings like humans, animals, plants, bacteria and even abstract entities like ideas, rumors, information, innovations and linguistic features. The book explores and communicates the laws behind these movements and reports about astonishing similarities and very specific features typical of the given object under considerations. Leading scientists in disciplines as different as archeology, epidemics, linguistics and sociology, in contact with their colleagues from engineering, natural sciences and mathematics, introduce into the phenomena of spreading as relevant for their fields. An introductory chapter on “Spreading Fundamentals” provides a common basis for all these considerations, with a minimum of mathematics, selected and presented for enjoying rather than frustrating the reader.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012277-3>

Interactive task learning : humans, robots, and agents acquiring new tasks through natural interactions ¤ Experts from a range of disciplines explore how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. Humans are not limited to a fixed set of innate or preprogrammed tasks. We learn quickly through language and other forms of natural interaction, and we improve our performance and teach others what we have learned. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of new tasks through natural interaction is an ongoing challenge. Advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics are leading us to future systems with human-like capabilities. A huge gap exists, however, between the highly specialized niche capabilities of current machine learning systems and the generality, flexibility, and in situ robustness of human instruction and learning. Drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines, this Strüngmann Forum Report explores how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. The contributors consider functional knowledge requirements, the ontology of interactive task learning, and the representation of task knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. They explore natural forms of interactions among humans as well as the use of interaction to teach robots and software agents new tasks in complex, dynamic environments. They discuss research challenges and opportunities, including ethical considerations, and make proposals to further understanding of interactive task learning and create new capabilities in assistive robotics, healthcare, education, training, and gaming.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120666-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>

Evaluating agri-environmental policies : design, practice and results ; [OECD Workshop on Evaluating Agri-Environmental Policies ... held on 6 - 8 December 2004 in Paris] ¤ These conference proceedings present a series of evaluations of agri-environmental policies in OECD countries. They examine how effective the policies have been in achieving objectives and what policy makers have learned about the design and implementation of their policies. These proceedings show that different methods of policy evaluation are complementary. Most countries focus on evaluating the environmental effectiveness rather than the economic efficiency of policies, using physical indicators rather than monetary values. Many policies are achieving their environmental objectives, but are taking longer than originally anticipated. The initiative being taken in many countries to incorporate monitoring and data collection into program design and implementation is a positive development. But a number of steps need to be taken to improve the quality of evaluations, including the better articulation of policy goals and objectives, improving data quality and establishing baselines for comparison.--Publisher's summary	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136995-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>

Paths to the Digital Future: What do Smart Living, Big Data, Robotics & Co. mean for the Social Economy?: Conference Volume for Social Talk 2017 ¤ Digitisation and mechanisation, in conjunction with network phenomena, are fundamentally changing the working and organisational world. They are both a complexity driver and a facilitator. The results of this for the social sector are accordingly multifaceted: new technology-based fields of work are emerging, powerful market players are appearing in changed value creation structures, and both management paradigms and specific requirements for employees and management are changing. Theory and practice are trying to conceptually grasp this new reality from a solution-oriented management perspective: exploration instead of exploitation, disruption instead of evolution or the contradictory concept of organisational ambidexterity. The contributions in this conference volume approach the facets of this complex phenomenon in an interdisciplinary manner, whereby theory and practice can meet on an equal footing, with the result that theoretical and empirical findings alternate with practical tests and findings.

Statistical learning theory and stochastic optimization : Ecole d'Été de Probabilités de Saint-Flour XXXI - 2001 ¤ Statistical learning theory is aimed at analyzing complex data with necessarily approximate models. This book is intended for an audience with a graduate background in probability theory and statistics. It will be useful to any reader wondering why it may be a good idea, to use as is often done in practice a notoriously "wrong'' (i.e. over-simplified) model to predict, estimate or classify. This point of view takes its roots in three fields: information theory, statistical mechanics, and PAC-Bayesian theorems. Results on the large deviations of trajectories of Markov chains with rare transitions are also included. They are meant to provide a better understanding of stochastic optimization algorithms of common use in computing estimators. The author focuses on non-asymptotic bounds of the statistical risk, allowing one to choose adaptively between rich and structured families of models and corresponding estimators. Two mathematical objects pervade the book: entropy and Gibbs measures. The goal is to show how to turn them into versatile and efficient technical tools, that will stimulate further studies and results.

The software project manager's handbook : principles that work at work ¤ Bring a new level of effectiveness to your software projects. Remember when creating software was fun? It could be again, if you use the methods in this book to help you plan and manage your project. In this new edition of The Software Project Manager's Handbook, expert Dwayne Phillips outlines the fundamental principles that project managers and software practitioners can use to help them succeed on any project. Success on software projects has more to do with how people think individually and in groups than with programming, asserts Phillips. In clear and concise steps, he shows software project managers and their team members how to manage projects effectively by paying attention to four basic principles: . Balancing people, process, and product . Making ideas visible . Applying configuration management properly . Using standards The book describes the requirements, planning, and risk management stages of the development cycle and examines the middle and late stages of development including design, test and integration, and maintenance. Phillips shares proven methods for dealing with common stumbling blocks for managers such as customers who want a voice in the design and endless test-fix cycles, and for planning maintenance so the customer is not left out of the process. Finally, the author examines past projects in detaildemonstrating why some projects were successful and why others failed. Phillips helps you apply these lessons with a	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047441-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
Introduction to Lipschitz geometry of singularities : lecture notes of the International School on Singularity Theory and Lipschitz Geometry, Cuernavaca, June 2018 ¤ This book presents a broad overview of the important recent progress which led to the emergence of new ideas in Lipschitz geometry and singularities, and started to build bridges to several major areas of singularity theory. Providing all the necessary background in a series of introductory lectures, it also contains Pham and Teissier's previously unpublished pioneering work on the Lipschitz classification of germs of plane complex algebraic curves. While a real or complex algebraic variety is topologically locally conical, it is in general not metrically conical; there are parts of its link with non-trivial topology which shrink faster than linearly when approaching the special point. The essence of the Lipschitz geometry of singularities is captured by the problem of building classifications of the germs up to local bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. The Lipschitz geometry of a singular space germ is then its equivalence class in this category. The book is aimed at graduate students and researchers from other fields of geometry who are interested in studying the multiple open questions offered by this new subject.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164905-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4569806-5>

VERSTRAETE and Martin BENISTON 1 Space Applications Institute, EC Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy 2 Department of Geography, University of Fribourg, Switzerland This volume contains the proceedings of the workshop entitled “Satellite Remote Sensing and Climate Simulations: Synergies and Limitations” that took place in Les Diablerets, Switzerland, September 20–24, 1999. This international scientific conference aimed at addressing the current and potential role of satellite remote sensing in climate modeling, with a particular focus on land surface processes and atmospheric aerosol characterization. Global and regional circulation models incorporate our knowledge of the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere. They are used to predict the evolution of the weather and climate. Mathematically, this system is represented by a set of partial differential equations whose solution requires initial and boundary conditions. Limitations in the accuracy and geographical distribution of these constraints, and intrinsic mathematical sensitivity to these conditions do not allow the identification of a unique solution (prediction). Additional observations on the climate system are thus used to constrain the forecasts of the mathematical model to remain close to the observed state of the system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>
Sensor Systems and Software : First International ICST Conference, S-CUBE 2009, Pisa, Italy, September 7-9, 2009, Revised Selected Papers ¤ This book constitutes the proceedings of the First International ICST Conference, S-CUBE 2009, held in Pisa, Italy, in september 2009. The 16 contributions published in this volume were carefully selected from 45 submitted works in a rigorous peer-reviewed process. In addition to this 3 distinguished researchers were asked to contribute 3 invited papers. The papers examine research challenges facing system development and software support for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Currently, wireless sensor networks introduce innovative and interesting application scenarios that may support a large amount of different applications including environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, building automation, object tracking, nuclear reactor control, fire detection, agriculture, healthcare, and traffic monitoring. The widespread acceptance of these new services can be improved by the definition of frameworks and architectures that have the potential to radically simplify software development for wireless sensor network based applications. The aim of these new architectures is to support flexible, scalable programming of applications based on adaptive middleware. As a consequence, WSNs require novel programming paradigms and technologies. Moreover the design of new complex systems, characterized by the interaction of different and heterogeneous resources, will allow the development of innovative applications that meet high performance goals. Hence, WSNs require contributions from many fields such as embedded systems, distributed systems, data management, system security and applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426067-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126945-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307964-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308224-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4789222-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139375-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274324-2>

The Nile : natural and cultural landscape in Egypt ¤ Although Herodot's dictum that 'Egypt is a gift of the Nile' is proverbial, there has been only scant attention to the way the river impacted on ancient Egyptian society. Egyptologists frequently focus on the textual and iconographic record, whereas archaeologists and earth scientists approach the issue from the perspective of natural sciences. The contributions in this volume bridge this gap by analyzing the river both as a natural and as a cultural phenomenon. Adopting an approach of cultural ecology, it addresses issues like ancient land use, administration and taxation, irrigation, and religious concepts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138608-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041389-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033573-2>
Infinite dimensional dynamical systems ¤ This collection covers a wide range of topics of infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, solitary equations, lattice differential equations, delay differential equations, and stochastic differential equations.Infinite dimensional dynamical systems are generated by equations describing the evolution in time of systems whose status must be depicted in infinite dimensional phase spaces. Studying the long-term behaviors of such systems is important in our understanding of their spatiotemporal pattern formation and global continuation, and has been among the major sources of motivation and applications of new developments in nonlinear analysis and other mathematical theories. The theory of infinite dimensional dynamical systems has also increasingly important applications in the physical, chemical and life sciences.This book collects 19 papers from 48 invited lecturers to the International Conference on Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems held at York University, Toronto, in September of 2008. As the conference was dedicated to Professor George Sell from University of Minnesota on the occasion of his 70th birthday, this collection reflects his pioneering work and influence in core areas of dynamical systems, including non-autonomous dynamical systems, skew-product flows, invariant manifolds theory, infinite dimensional dynamical systems, approximation dynamics, and fluid flows.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013396-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207956-1>

Körperlichkeit in der Philosophie der Spätantike. Corporeality in the Philosophy of Late Antiquity ¤ In this volume, the idea of the body and corporeality in the philosophy of late antiquity is examined. It deals with questions of ontology, mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, anthropology, politics, theology and aesthetics. The importance of the topic results both from its historical relevance (for the visual arts, literature, the specialist sciences, religion and general cultural history) as well as its philosophical importance. From a philosophical point of view the late antique reflection on corporeality contains an impressive array of meanings discussed in this volume.

Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics : Varna, Bulgaria, June 2013 ¤ Traditionally, Lie theory is a tool to build mathematical models for physical systems. Recently, the trend is towards geometrization of the mathematical description of physical systems and objects. A geometric approach to a system yields in general some notion of symmetry which is very helpful in understanding its structure. Geometrization and symmetries are meant in their widest sense, i.e., representation theory, algebraic geometry, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, superalgebras and supergroups, groups and quantum groups, noncommutative geometry, symmetries of linear and nonlinear PDE, special functions, and others. Furthermore, the necessary tools from functional analysis and number theory are included. This is a big interdisciplinary and interrelated field. Samples of these fresh trends are presented in this volume, based on contributions from the Workshop "Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics" held near Varna (Bulgaria) in June 2013. This book is suitable for a broad audience of mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and theoretical physicists and researchers in the field of Lie Theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037952-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130355-6>

The Next Generation of Electric Power Unit Commitment Models ¤ The Evolving Context for Unit Commitment Decisions -- Why this Book? New Capabilities and New Needs for Unit Commitment Modeling -- Regulatory Evolution, Market Design and Unit Commitment -- Development of an Electric Energy Market Simulator -- New Features in Unit Commitment Models -- Auctions with Explicit Demand-Side Bidding in Competitive Electricity Markets -- Thermal Unit Commitment with a Nonlinear AC Power Flow Network Model -- Optimal Self-Commitment under Uncertain Energy and Reserve Prices -- A Stochastic Model for a Price-Based Unit Commitment Problem and Its Application to Short-Term Generation Asset Valuation -- Probabilistic Unit Commitment under a Deregulated Market -- Algorithmic Advances -- Solving Hard Mixed-Integer Programs for Electricity Generation -- An Interior-Point/Cutting-Plane Algorithm to Solve the Dual Unit Commitment Problem — on Dual Variables, Duality Gap, and Cost Recovery -- Building and Evaluating GENCO Bidding Strategies and Unit Commitment Schedules with Genetic Algorithms -- An Equivalencing Technique for Solving the Large-Scale Thermal Unit Commitment Problem -- Decentralized Decision Making -- Strategic Unit Commitment for Generation in Deregulated Electricity Markets -- Optimization-Based Bidding Strategies for Deregulated Electric Power Markets -- Decentralized Nodal-Price Self-Dispatch and Unit Commitment -- Decentralized Unit Commitment in Competitive Energy Markets. Over the years, the electric power industry has been using optimization methods to help them solve the unit commitment problem. The result has been savings of tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. Things are changing, however. Optimization technology is improving, and the industry is undergoing radical restructuring. Consequently, the role of commitment models is changing, and the value of the improved solutions that better algorithms might yield is increasing. The dual purpose of this book is to explore the technology and needs of the next generation of computer models for aiding unit commitment decisions. Because of the unit commitment problem's size and complexity and because of the large economic benefits that could result from its improved solution, considerable attention has been devoted to algorithm development in the book. More systematic procedures based on a variety of widely researched algorithms have been proposed and tested. These techniques have included dynamic programming, branch-and-bound mixed integer programming (MIP), linear and network programming approaches, and Benders decomposition methods, among others. Recently, metaheuristic methods have been tested, such as genetic programming and simulated annealing, along with expert systems and neural networks. Because electric markets are changing rapidly, how UC models are solved and what purposes they serve need reconsideration. Hence, the book brings together people who understand the problem and people who know what improvements in algorithms are really possible. The two-fold result in The Next Generation of Electric Power Unit Commitment Models is an assessment of industry needs and new formulations and computational approaches that promise to make unit commitment models more responsive to those needs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134933-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8>

Coarse Geometry and Randomness : École d’Été de Probabilités de Saint-Flour XLI – 2011 ¤ These lecture notes study the interplay between randomness and geometry of graphs. The first part of the notes reviews several basic geometric concepts, before moving on to examine the manifestation of the underlying geometry in the behavior of random processes, mostly percolation and random walk. The study of the geometry of infinite vertex transitive graphs, and of Cayley graphs in particular, is fairly well developed. One goal of these notes is to point to some random metric spaces modeled by graphs that turn out to be somewhat exotic, that is, they admit a combination of properties not encountered in the vertex transitive world. These include percolation clusters on vertex transitive graphs, critical clusters, local and scaling limits of graphs, long range percolation, CCCP graphs obtained by contracting percolation clusters on graphs, and stationary random graphs, including the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and the stochastic hyperbolic planar quadrangulation (SHIQ).

Keyword index The near-field earthquake which struck the Hanshin-Awaji area of Japan before dawn on January 17, 1995, in addition to snatching away the lives of more than 6,000 people, inflicted horrendous damage on the region's infrastructure, including the transportation, communication and lifeline supply network and, of course, on buildings, too. A year earlier, the San Fernando Valley area of California had been hit by another near-field quake, the Northridge Earthquake, which dealt a similarly destructive blow to local infrastructures. Following these two disasters, structural engineers and researchers around the world have been working vigorously to develop methods of design for the kind of structure that is capable of withstanding not only the far-field tectonic earthquakes planned for hitherto, but also the full impact of near-field earthquake. Of the observed types of earthquake damage to steel structures, there are some whose causes are well understood, but many others continue to present us with unresolved problems. To overcome these, it is now urgently necessary for specialists to come together and exchange information. The contents of this volume are selected from the Nagoya Colloquium proceedings will become an important part of the world literature on structural stability and ductility, and will prove a driving force in the development of future stability and ductility related research and design	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056693-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056928-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149003-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290955-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182836-7>

Agents and Peer-to-Peer Computing : First International Workshop, AP2PC 2002 Bologna, Italy, July 15, 2002 Revised and Invited Papers ¤ Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing is currently attracting enormous public attention, spurred by the popularity of file-sharing systems such as Napster, Gnutella, and Morpheus. In P2P systems a very large number of autonomous computing nodes, the peers, rely on each other for services. P2P networks are emerging as a new distributed computing paradigm because of their potential to harness the computing power of the hosts composing the network, and because they make their underutilized resources available to each other. This book brings together three especially commissioned invited articles, an introduction, and revised versions of the papers presented at the 1st International Workshop on Agents and Peer-to-Peer Computing, AP2PC 2002, held in Bologna, Italy in July 2002. The book is organized into topical sections on peer-to-peer services, discovery and delivery of trustworthy services, and search and cooperation in peer-to-peer agent systems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343110-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130470-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455389-4>

Early Nutrition and its Later Consequences: New Opportunities : Perinatal Programming of Adult Health — EC Supported Research ¤ Health problems such as hypertension, tendency to diabetes, obesity, blood lipids, vascular disease, bone health, behaviour and learning and longevity may be 'imprinted' during early life. This process is defined as 'programming' whereby a nutritional stimulus operating at a critical, sensitive period of pre and postnatal life imprints permanent effects on the structure, physiology and metabolism. For this reason, academics and industry set-up the EC supported Scientific Workshop -Early Nutrition and its Later Consequences: New Opportunities. The prime objective of the Workshop was to generate a sound exchange of the latest scientific developments within the field of early nutrition to look for opportunities for new preventive health concepts. Further, a closer look was taken at the development of food applications which could provide (future) mothers and infants with improved nutrition that will ultimately lead to better future health. The Workshop was organised by the Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Munich, Germany in collaboration with the Danone Institutes and the Infant Nutrition Cluster, a collaboration of three large research projects funded by the EU.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015332-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010176-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015431-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051257-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173771-4>

Open Quantum Systems II : The Markovian Approach ¤ BEGIN Understanding dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems remains a challenge in mathematical physics. This problem is relevant in various areas of fundamental and applied physics. From a mathematical point of view, it involves a large body of knowledge. Significant progress in the understanding of such systems has been made during the last decade. These books present in a self-contained way the mathematical theories involved in the modeling of such phenomena. They describe physically relevant models, develop their mathematical analysis and derive their physical implications. In Volume I the Hamiltonian description of quantum open systems is discussed. This includes an introduction to quantum statistical mechanics and its operator algebraic formulation, modular theory, spectral analysis and their applications to quantum dynamical systems. Volume II is dedicated to the Markovian formalism of classical and quantum open systems. A complete exposition of noise theory, Markov processes and stochastic differential equations, both in the classical and the quantum context, is provided. These mathematical tools are put into perspective with physical motivations and applications. Volume III is devoted to recent developments and applications. The topics discussed include the non-equilibrium properties of open quantum systems, the Fermi Golden Rule and weak coupling limit, quantum irreversibility and decoherence, qualitative behaviour of quantum Markov semigroups and continual quantum measurements. Ergodic Properties of Markov Processes -- Open Classical Systems -- Quantum Noises -- Complete Positivity and the Markov structure of Open Quantum Systems -- Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations and Dilation of Completely Positive Semigroups.

The democratization of artificial intelligence : net politics in the era of learning algorithms ¤ After a long time of neglect, Artificial Intelligence is once again at the center of most of our political, economic, and socio-cultural debates. Recent advances in the field of Artificial Neural Networks have led to a renaissance of dystopian and utopian speculations on an AI-rendered future. Algorithmic technologies are deployed for identifying potential terrorists through vast surveillance networks, for producing sentencing guidelines and recidivism risk profiles in criminal justice systems, for demographic and psychographic targeting of bodies for advertising or propaganda, and more generally for automating the analysis of language, text, and images. Against this background, the aim of this book is to discuss the heterogenous conditions, implications, and effects of modern AI and Internet technologies in terms of their political-dimension: What does it mean to critically investigate efforts of net politics in the age of machine learning algorithms?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124941-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7854804-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074660-4>
Formation of Order and Knowledge Processes ¤ Formation of order and cognition are interdependent. Knowledge presupposes the observation of order structures or their creation through abstraction and modelling. Contributions from different areas of university research examine structures that relate to (partially) autonomous actors (or agents) and the dynamic processes in which they are developed. Processes of knowledge that take place in this context require structures of order that can be experienced interobjectively, and in some cases can also be grasped in symbolism and rituals, even if these structures are created simultaneously with processes of action or knowledge. Recursive references can lead to forms of self-organization. In more highly developed structures, aspects of knowledge, learning (and forgetting) can be included and additionally strengthened or weakened by emotional states.On November 5, 2005, scientists came together for a workshop on "Formation of Order and Knowledge Processes" at the University of Hamburg. In this volume, numerous of the given talks and articles are collected	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015286-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043744-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058125-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027274-6>

ISS-2012 proceedings volume on longitudinal data analysis subject to measurement errors, missing values, and/or outliers : [International Symposium in Statistics on Longitudinal Data Analysis Subject to Outliers, Measurement Errors and/or Missing Values held at Memorial University, Canada from July 16 - 18, 2012] ¤ This proceedings volume contains nine selected papers that were presented in the International Symposium in Statistics, 2012 held at Memorial University from July 16 to 18. These nine papers cover three different areas for longitudinal data analysis, four dealing with longitudinal data subject to measurement errors, four on incomplete longitudinal data analysis, and the last one for inferences for longitudinal data subject to outliers. Unlike in the independence setup, the inferences in measurement errors, missing values, and/or outlier models, are not adequately discussed in the longitudinal setup. The papers in the present volume provide details on successes and further challenges in these three areas for longitudinal data analysis. This volume is the first outlet with current research in three important areas in the longitudinal setup. The nine papers presented in three parts clearly reveal the similarities and differences in inference techniques used for three different longitudinal setups. Because the research problems considered in this volume are encountered in many real life studies in biomedical, clinical, epidemiology, socioeconomic, econometrics, and engineering fields, the volume should be useful to the researchers including graduate students in these areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034036-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040708-1>

Regional governance : new modes of self-government in the European Community ; EuroConference 19. - 21. April 2001 in Hanover ¤ The topic of a Scientific EuroConference held in Hannover/Germany, from April 19th to 21st 2001 was Regional Governance and was subsidized by the European Commission, Human Potential Programme. The publication presents an overview over the objectives, the organization, the content and the results of the conference. The background for organizing the venue refers to the fact that during the last ten years "regional governance" has become a topic of scientific discussion, fueled by the influence of globalization, the EC policies (structural funds, ESDP-process, Committee of the Regions etc.) and regionalization strategies of the member states. In addition, the EC has organized a discourse on "governance" in the wake of the "Nice-process". The objectives of the conference were: to get more insights into the present discussion on "regional governance", to identify open research questions concerning the general topic, to organize an academic discourse between younger and senior researchers within Europe and to mobilize young researchers of different member states of the EC to form research networks on some of the identified research questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455020-0>

In the Temple of the Self: The Artist's House as a Total Work of Art; Europe and America 1800-1948 ¤ As treasure troves of creativity, the homes of artists reflect the intellectual worlds of their creators. Starting with the Villa Stuck in Munich--the aesthetic, conceptual cosmos and life's work of the aristocratic artist Franz von Stuck--this volume integrates the artist's house as a category into the international context and is the first to assign these buildings the status of major works. About twenty examples bring to life the fascination that these artistic fantasies hold for art lovers, including both existing projects and some which, although they have been lost, were of unique importance in their day and still retain their charisma. Along with paintings, sculptures, and photographs closely related to the houses, plans and models convey the correlation between art and life as well as the kind of harmony of the arts expressed in Richard Wagner's historical concept of the total work of art	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033423-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023693-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156925-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4466237-3>

Digital Mammography : 8th International Workshop, IWDM 2006, Manchester, UK, June 18-21, 2006, Proceedings ¤ Breast Density -- CAD -- Clinical Practice -- Tomosynthesis -- Registration and Multiple View Mammography -- Physics Models -- Poster Session -- Wavelet Methods -- Full-Field Digital Mammography -- Segmentation. This volume of Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series records the proceedings of the 8 International Workshop on Digital Mammography (IWDM), which was held in Manchester, UK, June 18–21, 2006. The meetings bring together a diverse set of researchers (physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers), clinicians (radiologists, surgeons) and representatives of industry, who are jointly committed to developing technology, not just for its own sake, but to support clinicians in the early detection and subsequent patient management of breast cancer. The conference series was initiated at a 1993 meeting of the SPIE in San Jose, with subsequent meetings hosted every two years by researchers around the world. Previous meetings were held in York, Chicago, Nijmegen, Toronto, Bremen, and North Carolina. It is interesting to reflect on the changes that have occurred during the past 13 years. Then, the dominant technology was film-screen mammography; now it is full-field digital mammography. Then, there were few screening programmes world-wide; now there are many. Then, there was the hope that computer-aided detection (CAD) of early signs of cancer might be possible; now CAD is not only a reality but (more importantly) a commercially led clinical reality. Then, algorithms were almost entirely heuristic with little clinical support; now there is a requirement for substantial clinical support for any algorithm that is developed and published. However, upon reflection, could we have predicted with absolute certainty what would be the key questions to be addressed over the subsequent (say) six years? No! That is the nature, joy, and frustration of research. There are more blind alleys to explore than there are rich veins that bring gold (in all senses of that analogy!).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139030-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140560-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037274-1>

Model cellulosic surfaces : [based on a symposium entitled "Model Cellulosic Surfaces", which was held on March 25 - 26, 2007 in Chicago, IL during the 233rd ACS national meeting] ¤ Molecular interactions of cellulose surfaces govern the three-dimensional assembly of plant cell walls and play important roles in the pulp and paper, textile, and food industries. Interactions of cellulose surfaces with other polysaccharides, proteins, polynucleotides, and mammalian cells are of interest for biomedical cellulose applications and, more recently, interactions of cellulolytic enzymes with cellulosic substrates is of interest in the production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The study of interactions and sorption phenomena involving cellulose and cellulosic materials requires well-defined model surfaces. Several methods to prepare such model surfaces have been developed over the past fifteen years and an increasing number of cellulose interaction studies involving such model surfaces can be found in the literature	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126166-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431018-3>

Geometric Properties for Parabolic and Elliptic PDEs ¤ The study of qualitative aspects of PDEs has always attracted much attention from the early beginnings. More recently, once basic issues about PDEs, such as existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions, have been understood quite well, research on topological and/or geometric properties of their solutions has become more intense. The study of these issues is attracting the interest of an increasing number of researchers and is now a broad and well-established research area, with contributions that often come from experts from disparate areas of mathematics, such as differential and convex geometry, functional analysis, calculus of variations, mathematical physics, to name a few. This volume collects a selection of original results and informative surveys by a group of international specialists in the field, analyzes new trends and techniques and aims at promoting scientific collaboration and stimulating future developments and perspectives in this very active area of research.

Stochastic Geometry : Lectures given at the C.I.M.E. Summer School held in Martina Franca, Italy, September 13–18, 2004 ¤ BEGIN Spatial Point Processes and their Applications -- Random Polytopes, Convex Bodies, and Approximation -- Integral Geometric Tools for Stochastic Geometry -- Random Sets (in Particular Boolean Models) -- Random Mosaics -- On the Evolution Equations of Mean Geometric Densities for a Class of Space and Time Inhomogeneous Stochastic Birth-and-growth Processes. Stochastic Geometry is the mathematical discipline which studies mathematical models for random geometric structures, as they appear frequently in almost all natural sciences or technical fields. Although its roots can be traced back to the 18th century (the Buffon needle problem), the modern theory of random sets was founded by D. Kendall and G. Matheron in the early 1970's. Its rapid development was influenced by applications in Spatial Statistics and by its close connections to Integral Geometry. The volume "Stochastic Geometry" contains the lectures given at the CIME summer school in Martina Franca in September 1974. The four main lecturers covered the areas of Spatial Statistics, Random Points, Integral Geometry and Random Sets, they are complemented by two additional contributions on Random Mosaics and Crystallization Processes. The book presents an up-to-date description of important parts of Stochastic Geometry. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133202-7>

Topics in Modern Operator Theory : 5th International Conference on Operator Theory, Timişoara and Herculane (Romania), June 2–12, 1980 ¤ The first of the annual Operator Theory conferences in Timișoara, held four years ago, was a meeting of operator theory specialists from the National Institute for Scientific and Technical Creation in Bucharest and from the University of Timișoara. Since then, the participation to these conferences has greatly increased, by being attended first by operator theorists from all over the country and (since 1978) by an increasing number of foreign mathematicians. Thus the 1980 Conference can be regarded as a truly international Operator Theory meeting, fifteen countries being represented at it. These conferences are conceived as a means to promote the cooperation between specialists in all areas of Operator Theory. Among the main topics in 1980 were: dilation theory, invariant subspaces, connections with the theory of C*-algebras, subnormal operators, multidimensional functional calculus etc. Though not included in this volume, we would like to mention that in 1980 some special sessions concerning other fields of Functional Analysis were organized at the Operator Theory conference. The research contracts of the Department of Mathematics of INCREST with the National Council for Sciences and Technology of Romania provided the means for developing the research activity in Functional Analysis; these contracts constitute the generous framework for these meetings.

Planetary nebulae: multi-wavelength probes of stellar and galactic evolution : proceedings of the 323rd Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Beijing, China, October 10-14, 2016 ¤ Planetary nebulae, glowing shells of ionized gas, are the spectacular products of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. For astrophysicists, they are important laboratories for the understanding of atomic, molecular, dust, and plasma processes in different cosmic environments; they enable the exploration of the fundamental physics of single and binary star evolution including nucleosynthesis, rotation, mass transfer and loss, and magnetic fields; and they help trace stellar populations, the kinematics, and chemistry of galaxies including our own galaxy, the Milky Way. This volume reviews the current status of this vibrant research field in the form of invited reviews, contributed talks, and posters presented at the IAU Symposium 323. It should be of interest to researchers and advanced students interested in this field and in related fields, including stellar physics, the interstellar medium, and Galactic and extragalactic astronomy -- Publisher description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174792-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057375-8>

Faking, forging, counterfeiting : discredited practices at the margins of mimesis ¤ Forgeries are an omnipresent part of our culture and closely related to traditional ideas of authenticity, legality, authorship, creativity, and innovation. Based on the concept of mimesis, this volume illustrates how forgeries must be understood as autonomous aesthetic practices - creative acts in themselves - rather than as mere rip-offs of an original work of art. The proceedings bring together research from different scholarly fields. They focus on various mimetic practices such as pseudo-translations, imposters, identity theft, and hoaxes in different artistic and historic contexts. By opening up the scope of the aesthetic implications of fakes, this anthology aims to consolidate forging as an autonomous method of creation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016247-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046196-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170992-5>

New Prospects in Direct, Inverse and Control Problems for Evolution Equations ¤ This book, based on a selection of talks given at a dedicated meeting in Cortona, Italy, in June 2013, shows the high degree of interaction between a number of fields related to applied sciences. Applied sciences consider situations in which the evolution of a given system over time is observed, and the related models can be formulated in terms of evolution equations (EEs). These equations have been studied intensively in theoretical research and are the source of an enormous number of applications. In this volume, particular attention is given to direct, inverse and control problems for EEs. The book provides an updated overview of the field, revealing its richness and vitality 1 F.

Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions : Results of SSPCR 2017 ¤ This book comprises a selection of the top contributions presented at the second international conference “Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions 2017”, held in March 2017 in Bolzano, Italy. Featuring forty-six papers by policy-makers, academics and consultants, it discusses current groundbreaking research in smart and sustainable planning, including the progress made in overcoming cities’ challenges towards improving the quality of life. Climate change adaptation and mitigation of global warming, generally identified as drivers of global policies, are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to smart energy transition. Indeed, equally relevant towards this current transformation – and key topics in this volume – are ICTs, public spaces and society; next economy for the city; strategies and actions for good governance; urban-rural innovation; rethinking mobility. The book’s depth in understanding and insightfulness in re-thinking demonstrate the breaking of new ground in smart and sustainable planning. A new ground that policy-makers, academics and consultants may build upon as a bedrock for smart and sustainable planning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0>
Tracing the ancestry of galaxies (on the land of our ancestors) : proceedings of the 277th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, December 13 - 17, 2010 ¤ We are living in the golden era of multiwavelength astronomical observations, probing deep areas of the sky. Sophisticated instruments allow us to compare galaxies at high redshifts, when the Universe was only a few hundred millions years old, with the mature nearby galaxies we see today. This is yielding new insights into the mass assembly and the star formation history of galaxies that may, or may not, be compatible with our current theoretical models. IAU Symposium 277 addresses the major open questions concerning the evolution of galaxies, specifically: can we really apply the knowledge gained from low-redshift studies to the high-redshift galaxy populations, given the strong apparent differences in their observed properties? In this volume theorists and observers attempt to reach a common understanding of the puzzles that galaxy research has recently unfolded, largely through the study of galaxy dynamics and their stellar populations at low and high redshifts. -- Back cover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057375-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156614-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4462534-0>

Harmonic analysis, signal processing, and complexity : Festschrift in honor of the 60th birthday of Carlos A. Berenstein ¤ Carlos A. Berenstein has had a profound influence on scholars and practitioners alike amid a distinguished mathematical career spanning nearly four decades. His uncommon capability of adroitly moving between these parallel worlds is demonstrated by the breadth of his research interests, from his early theoretical work on interpolation in spaces of entire functions with growth conditions and residue theory to his later work on deconvolution and its applications to issues ranging from optics to the study of blood flow. This volume, which celebrates his sixtieth birthday, reflects the state-of-the-art in these areas. Original articles and survey articles, all refereed, cover topics in harmonic and complex analysis, as well as more applied work in signal processing. TOC: Preface * John Baras * Carlos A.

Recent advances in growth research : nutritional, molecular and endocrine perspectives ; 71st Nestlé Nutrition Institute workshop, Vienna, October 2011 ¤ Growth in mammals encompasses several stages, from intrauterine growth through infancy and childhood to adolescence. Each of these phases is characterized by very specific nutritional, molecular and endocrine perspectives which, under ideal conditions, allow the organism to achieve its genetically programmed growth patterns.In this book, an international panel of experts addresses these topics in a historical, physiological and social perspective. The first part investigates the genetic, epigenetic, molecular and nutritional determinants of intrauterine and postnatal growth. Part two deals with non-evolutionary changes which occurred in the recent past, such as changes in body size in utero, during infancy and childhood, and during adolescence, and the potentially unfavorable consequences of enhanced nutrition and growth, including early onset of puberty, development of obesity, and increases in metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The last part addresses the question of which factors define healthy growth in light of the influence of nutritional, molecular and endocrine influences. Although the association between rapid changes in body size and adverse health effects is clear, the precise nature of causality remains uncertain. Presenting the latest scientific findings in growth research, this publication provides essential reading for pediatricians, clinical investigators and health workers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064115-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152440-8>

Competitive failures in insurance markets : theory and policy implications ¤ CESifo Seminar Series "Competitive Failures in Insurance Markets Theory and Policy Implications" edited by Pierre-André Chiappori and Christian Gollier Risk sharing is a cornerstone of modern economies. It is valuable to risk-averse consumers and essential for investment and entrepreneurs. The standard economic model of risk exchange predicts that competition in insurance markets will result in all individual risks being insured--that all diversifiable risks in the economy will be covered through mutual risk-sharing arrangements--but in practice this is not the case. Many diversifiable risks are still borne by individuals; many environmental, catastrophic, and technological risks are not covered by insurance contracts. In this CESifo volume, leading international economists provide new insights on recent developments in the economic analysis of the limits of insurability. They find that asymmetric information is a central reason why competition in insurance markets may fail to guarantee that mutually advantageous risk exchanges are realized in today's economies. In particular, adverse selection and moral hazard help explain why competitive insurance markets fail to provide an efficient level of insurance and hence why public intervention is required to solve the problem. The contributors offer theoretical models of insurance markets involving adverse selection as well as empirical analyses of health insurance and non-health insurance markets in countries including Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137895-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382291-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8>

Crisis of the Future I : Apocalyptic Discourses in Interdisciplinary Discussion ¤ Negative expectations saturate the current debates about the future, and apocalyptic images are omnipresent. Are there other reasons for this than mere facts? The interdisciplinary studies by the fellows of the ZRWP’s Basler Forschungskolleg (Basel Research School) that are collated here address this question—and find surprising answers. The future seems uncertain, yes threatening. Whether climate change, possible collapse of the markets or the development of Western democracies: omnipresent one sees oneself confronted with possible catastrophes. With the intensive discussions about the future, the authors of this interdisciplinary volume deal with, namely in analytical-historical perspectives. For the way one looks at the future is neither arbitrary nor general, but strongly shaped by religious-apocalyptic thought patterns and worlds of imagination. The detailed background analyses give surprising answers to apocalyptic scenarios of our time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002431-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027274-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029929-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191125-8>
Computational modelling of concrete and concrete structures ¤ Computational Modelling of Concrete and Concrete Structures contains the contributions to the EURO-C 2022 conference (Vienna, Austria, 23-26 May 2022). The papers review and discuss research advancements and assess the applicability and robustness of methods and models for the analysis and design of concrete, fibre-reinforced and prestressed concrete structures, as well as masonry structures. Recent developments include methods of machine learning, novel discretisation methods, probabilistic models, and consideration of a growing number of micro-structural aspects in multi-scale and multi-physics settings. In addition, trends towards the material scale with new fibres and 3D printable concretes, and life-cycle oriented models for ageing and durability of existing and new concrete infrastructure are clearly visible. Overall computational robustness of numerical predictions and mathematical rigour have further increased, accompanied by careful model validation based on respective experimental programmes. The book will serve as an important reference for both academics and professionals, stimulating new research directions in the field of computational modelling of concrete and its application to the analysis of concrete structures. EURO-C 2022 is the eighth edition of the EURO-C conference series after Innsbruck 1994, Bad Gastein 1998, St. Johann im Pongau 2003, Mayrhofen 2006, Schladming 2010, St. Anton am Arlberg 2014, and Bad Hofgastein 2018.

Core Monitoring for Commercial Reactors: Improvements in Systems and Methods : Workshop Proceedings, Stockholm 4-5 October 1999 ¤ The opening of energy markets is leading to increased competition, and the nuclear power industry must adapt if it is to meet this challenge. Internationally discussions are taking place among government authorities and electric utilities and vendors on how to deal with the rapid technical development and optimisation of nuclear fuel and its utilisation under new, more aggressive fuel management strategies. Improving reactor core monitoring systems is an important part of this process. Participants in a recent NEA workshop discussed how instrumentation, methods and models used in core monitoring can be validated or, if needed, improved and further developed to provide more reliable and detailed information on local power in the core and on other parameters indirectly affecting fuel duty. This book shows how the core monitoring system can be used to support reactor operation in normal and anticipated transient modes and to supply data used to derive initial key core parameters for transient and accident analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144208-8>

Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis : Israel Seminar (GAFA) 2017-2019 Volume I ¤ Continuing the theme of the previous volume, these seminar notes reflect general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. Two classical topics represented are the Concentration of Measure Phenomenon in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces, which has recently had triumphs in Random Matrix Theory, and the Central Limit Theorem, one of the earliest examples of regularity and order in high dimensions. Central to the text is the study of the Poincaré and log-Sobolev functional inequalities, their reverses, and other inequalities, in which a crucial role is often played by convexity assumptions such as Log-Concavity. The concept and properties of Entropy form an important subject, with Bourgain's slicing problem and its variants drawing much attention. Constructions related to Convexity Theory are proposed and revisited, as well as inequalities that go beyond the Brunn–Minkowski theory. One of the major current research directions addressed is the identification of lower-dimensional structures with remarkable properties in rather arbitrary high-dimensional objects. In addition to functional analytic results, connections to Computer Science and to Differential Geometry are also discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156708-0>

Urban imaginaries : locating the modern city ; [Project on Cities and Urban Knowledges ; conference at Kemer, Turkey] ¤ "For millennia, the city stood out against the landscape, walled and compact. This concept of the city was long accepted as adequate for characterizing the urban experience. However, the nature of the city, both real and imagined, has always been more permeable than this model reveals. The essays in [this book] respond to this condition by focusing on how social and physical space is conceived as both indefinite and singular. They emphasize the ways this space is shared and thus made into urban culture. Urban Imaginaries offers case studies on cities in Brazil, Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, and India, as well as in the United States and France, and in doing so blends social, cultural, and political approaches to better understand the contemporary urban experience."--Publisher description, from p.

BC architects & studies - The act of building ¤ From the first field trips for the design of a library in Burundi to involving over 150 workshop participants in the construction of a public building in Belgium, the stories compiled in this book tell how BC architects & studies engage in acts of building. BC believes that, in order to have a positive impact on our society, architects need to intervene beyond the narrow definition of the professional who designs and controls the execution of buildings. Hence, BC ventures into material production, contracting, storytelling, knowledge transfer, community organization, which influence their design approach.0By describing the way BC architects & studies design and perform the act of building, the book suggests a trajectory of how BC hopes architecture can contribute to our world in transition.00Exhibition: Belgian Pavilion, 16th Architecture Biennale, Venice, Italy (26.05.-25.11.2018)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2>

In a workshop held in Paris, June 2010 several prominent researchers gave exciting talks in honor of his 60th birthday. The present volume includes scientific contributions from this workshop. Probability theory is first and foremost aimed at solving real-life problems containing randomness. Markov processes are one of the key tools for modeling that plays a vital part concerning such problems. Contributions on inventory control, mutation-selection in genetics and public-private partnerships illustrate several applications in this volume. Stochastic differential equations, be they partial or ordinary, also play a key role in stochastic modeling. Two of the contributions analyze examples that share a focus on probabilistic tools, namely stochastic analysis and stochastic calculus. Three other papers are devoted more to the theoretical development of these aspects. The volume addresses graduate students and researchers interested in stochastic analysis and its applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132272-1>

Sparse grids are a popular tool for the numerical treatment of high-dimensional problems. Where classical numerical discretization schemes fail in more than three or four dimensions, sparse grids, in their different flavors, are frequently the method of choice. This volume of LNCSE presents selected papers from the proceedings of the fifth workshop on sparse grids and applications, and demonstrates once again the importance of this numerical discretization scheme. The articles present recent advances in the numerical analysis of sparse grids in connection with a range of applications including uncertainty quantification, plasma physics simulations, and computational chemistry, to name but a few.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4411841-7>

The Corona Problem : Connections Between Operator Theory, Function Theory, and Geometry ¤ The purpose of the corona workshop was to consider the corona problem in both one and several complex variables, both in the context of function theory and harmonic analysis as well as the context of operator theory and functional analysis. It was held in June 2012 at the Fields Institute in Toronto, and attended by about fifty mathematicians. This volume validates and commemorates the workshop, and records some of the ideas that were developed within. The corona problem dates back to 1941. It has exerted a powerful influence over mathematical analysis for nearly 75 years. There is material to help bring people up to speed in the latest ideas of the subject, as well as historical material to provide background. Particularly noteworthy is a history of the corona problem, authored by the five organizers, that provides a unique glimpse at how the problem and its many different solutions have developed. There has never been a meeting of this kind, and there has never been a volume of this kind. Mathematicians-both veterans and newcomers-will benefit from reading this book.

Entrepreneurship and innovations in functional regions ¤ In recent decades, the world has witnessed the emergence of a global knowledge economy in which functional regions increasingly play a role as independent and dynamic market places. These are integrated with other functional regions by means of flows of information, knowledge, and commodities. This contemporary and illuminating book provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on innovation and entrepreneurship in functional regions. There are numerous questions regarding entrepreneurship and innovation in functional regions that have not yet been answered - until now. Some of the issues that the expert contributors in this field question are - How do firms compete and how do they develop their competitive strategies? How important are entrepreneurial actions and innovation? How important are firm size, firm maturity and corporate structure for innovation? Entrepreneurship and Innovations in Functional Regions will be an invaluable resource for students and scholars of entrepreneurship, business economics, innovation and regional science	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130470-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017897-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031370-0>

Social Law 4.0 : new approaches for ensuring and financing social security in the digital age ¤ Digitalisation and the changing world of work are calling into question the standard employment model as a basis for social security systems. Whilst a growing number of publications deal with the consequences for industrial relations and labour law, social law is still being left out of most research projects on digital work. This book aims at widening the perspective. It concentrates on the two most important questions in the context of social protection in a digitalised world, namely access to social protection systems and their future financing, putting emphasis on platform work. It gives an overview of different national approaches to these questions, it analyses the respective solutions in a comparative manner, and it puts them into a transnational context. By bringing together case studies from Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, France and Estonia and addressing the specific reform challenges for EU standard setting, EU coordination and the relation to tax law, the book provides new insights on what a “Social Law 4.0” should look like.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017182-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002805-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055905-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055892-7>
