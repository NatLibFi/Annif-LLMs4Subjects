Im Tempel des Ich : das KÃ¼nstlerhaus als Gesamtkunstwerk ; Europa und Amerika 1800 - 1948
As treasure troves of creativity, the homes of artists reflect the intellectual worlds of their creators. Starting with the Villa Stuck in Munich--the aesthetic, conceptual cosmos and life's work of the aristocratic artist Franz von Stuck--this volume integrates the artist's house as a category into the international context and is the first to assign these buildings the status of major works. About twenty examples bring to life the fascination that these artistic fantasies hold for art lovers, including both existing projects and some which, although they have been lost, were of unique importance in their day and still retain their charisma. Along with paintings, sculptures, and photographs closely related to the houses, plans and models convey the correlation between art and life as well as the kind of harmony of the arts expressed in Richard Wagner's historical concept of the total work of art
