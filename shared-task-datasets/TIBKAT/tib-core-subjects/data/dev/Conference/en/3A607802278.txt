Model cellulosic surfaces : [based on a symposium entitled "Model Cellulosic Surfaces", which was held on March 25 - 26, 2007 in Chicago, IL during the 233rd ACS national meeting]
"Molecular interactions of cellulose surfaces govern the three-dimensional assembly of plant cell walls and play important roles in the pulp and paper, textile, and food industries. Interactions of cellulose surfaces with other polysaccharides, proteins, polynucleotides, and mammalian cells are of interest for biomedical cellulose applications and, more recently, interactions of cellulolytic enzymes with cellulosic substrates is of interest in the production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The study of interactions and sorption phenomena involving cellulose and cellulosic materials requires well-defined model surfaces. Several methods to prepare such model surfaces have been developed over the past fifteen years and an increasing number of cellulose interaction studies involving such model surfaces can be found in the literature
