Nanotechnology in catalysis, volume 3 : [mainly based on the Symposium on Nanotechnology in Catalysis III which was held in fall 2004 at the ACS 228th national meeting in Philadelphia, PA]
This volume continues the tradition formed in Nanotechnology in Catalysis 1 and 2. As with those books, this one is based upon an ACS symposium. Some of the most illustrious names in heterogeneous catalysis are among the contributors. The book covers: Design, synthesis, and control of catalysts at nanoscale, understanding of catalytic reaction at nanometer scale, characterization of nanomaterials as catalysts, nanoparticle metal or metal oxides catalysts, nanomaterials as catalyst supports, new catalytic applications of nanomaterials.
