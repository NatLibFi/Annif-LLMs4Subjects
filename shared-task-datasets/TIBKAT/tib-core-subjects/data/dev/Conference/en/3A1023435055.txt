Network knowledge in international business
This book focuses on current cutting-edge research concerning the increasing strategic importance of subsidiary networks to the multinational firm. It combines contributions from three major related areas of inquiry: the changing theoretical conception of networks and the structure of the multinational firm, the importance of spillovers and agglomeration economies related to multinational investments, and the management of the flow of information and knowledge from headquarters to subsidiaries and vice versa
