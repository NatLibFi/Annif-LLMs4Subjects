This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology, AMAST 2000, held in Iowa City, Iowa, USA, in May 2000. The 20 revised full papers presented together with eight invited contributions were carefully reviewed and selected from a total of 53 submissions. Among the topics covered are all current issues in formal methods related to algebraic approaches including abstract data types, abstract state machines, algebraic state machines, algebraic compilers, state charts, process algebras, etc. The algebraic methods are applied to reactive systems, safety-critical systems, concurrency, Java, UML, etc
