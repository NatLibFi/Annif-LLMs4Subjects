Recent advances in kinetic equations and applications
The volume covers most of the topics addressed and discussed during the Workshop "Recent advances in kinetic equations and applications", which took place in Rome (Italy), from November 11th to November 15th, 2019. The volume contains results on kinetic equations for reactive and nonreactive mixtures and on collisional and noncollisional Vlasov equations for plasmas. Some contributions are devoted to the study of phase transition phenomena, kinetic problems with nontrivial boundary conditions and hierarchies of models. The book, addressed to researchers interested in the mathematical and numerical study of kinetic equations, provides an overview of recent advances in the field and future research directions.
