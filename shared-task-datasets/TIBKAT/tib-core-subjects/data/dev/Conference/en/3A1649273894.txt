Information Security : 5th International Conference, ISC 2002 Sao Paulo, Brazil, September 30 – October 2, 2002 Proceedings
As distinct from other security and cryptography conferences, the Information Security Conference (ISC) 2002 brought together individuals involved in a wide variety of different disciplines of information security to foster the exchange of ideas. The conference is an outgrowth of the Information Security Workshop, first held in Ishikawa, Japan 1997. ISC 2002 was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on September 30– October 2, 2002. The Program Committee considered 81 submissions of which 38 papers were accepted for presentation. These proceedings contain revised versions of the accepted papers. The papers provide a representative sample of both the variety and the truly international scope of information security research conducted currently. The topics addressed range from e-commerce protocols to access control and trust management, and to cryptography and cryptographic algorithms. Many people deserve our gratitude for their contribution to the success of the conference. We would like to thank the General Chair, Routo Terada, for overseeing the local arrangements, including registration and maintaining the conference website, and for the smooth running of the conference. We are grateful to Robbie Ye for his expert help in processing the electronic submissions, reviews and acceptance notifications. Robbie’s enthusiasm and energy greatly simplified the Program Committee’s task of conducting the on-line evaluation of the submitted papers under tight time constraints.
