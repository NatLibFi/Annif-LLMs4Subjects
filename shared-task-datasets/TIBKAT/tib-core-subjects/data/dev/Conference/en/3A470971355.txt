Stochastic methods in finance : lectures given at the C.I.M.E.-E.M.S. Summer School held in Bressanone/Brixen, Italy, July 6 - 12, 2003
This volume includes the five lecture courses given&nbsp;at the CIME-EMS School on "Stochastic Methods in Finance" held in Bressanone/Brixen, Italy 2003. It&nbsp;deals with&nbsp;innovative methods, mainly from stochastic analysis, that play a fundamental role in the mathematical modelling of finance and insurance: the theory of stochastic processes, optimal and stochastic control, stochastic differential equations, convex analysis and duality theory. Five topics are treated in detail: Utility maximization in incomplete markets; the theory of nonlinear expectations and its relationship with the theory of risk measures in a dynamic setting; credit risk modelling; the interplay between finance and insurance; incomplete information in the context of economic equilibrium and insider trading.
