Geodesy and Physics of the Earth : Geodetic Contributions to Geodynamics
The investigation of the kinematics and dynamics of the Earth has achieved remarkable progresses in the last decades in understanding and explaining a large variety of geo- dynamical, geophysical and geological phenomena. The impact of increasingly precise geodetic space-time measurements and analyses have much contributed to these results. Papers presented atthe 7th International Symposium on Geodesy and Physics of the Earth focus onfour topics: - Present Day Tectonic Motions - Gravity Field and its Variation - Earth Rotation Characteristics - International Programs for Geodesy and Geodynamics Researchers and advanced students may use this volume as a comprehensive reference of concepts, techniques and results
