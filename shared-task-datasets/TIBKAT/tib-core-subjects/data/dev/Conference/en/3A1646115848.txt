Networked Embedded Sensing and Control : Workshop NESC'05: University of Notre Dame, USA, October 2005 Proceedings
Recent technological developments in sensing, communications, control and computation have created an emerging class of complex systems hereon called networked embedded systems. These systems can be roughly described as collections of spatially distributed sensors, actuators and controllers whose behaviour is coordinated through wired or wireless communication links. This integration between different technologies and scientific domains presents new and challenging fundamental problems underlying the theoretical foundations for this class of systems. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers working of different aspects of networked embedded systems in order to exchange research experiences and to identify the main scientific challenges in this exciting new area.
Part I Multi-Agent Control -- Part II Simulation and Implementation -- Part III Distributed Sensing, Filtering and Estimation -- Part IV Control over Networks I -- Part V Control over Networks II.
