Control of Boundaries and Stabilization : Proceedings of the IFIP WG 7.2 Conference Clermont Ferrand, France, June 20-23, 1988
The present proceedings volume is devoted to two subjects. Stabilization with emphasis on exact controllability: considering a physical system, such as a vibrating plate, one can reach a steady state in a finite time by acting on the boundary. Control of boundaries: given a physical system find the geometry of the domain (optimal shape) which minimizes a cost related to the solution of a boundary value problem in this domain, for example find a minimum drag profile. Many lectures included mathematical analysis as well as engineering applications and numerical simulation
