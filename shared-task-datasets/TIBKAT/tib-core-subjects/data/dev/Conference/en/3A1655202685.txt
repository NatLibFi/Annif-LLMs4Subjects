Orthogonal Polynomials and their Applications : Proceedings of an International Symposium held in Segovia, Spain, Sept. 22–27, 1986
The Segovia meeting set out to stimulate an intensive exchange of ideas between experts in the area of orthogonal polynomials and its applications, to present recent research results and to reinforce the scientific and human relations among the increasingly international community working in orthogonal polynomials. This volume contains original research papers as well as survey papers about fundamental questions in the field (Nevai, Rakhmanov & López) and its relationship with other fields such as group theory (Koornwinder), Padé approximation (Brezinski), differential equations (Krall, Littlejohn) and numerical methods (Rivlin)
