This book includes high-quality papers presented at the Symposium 2019, organised by Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT), in Sikkim from 26â€“27 February 2019. It discusses common research problems and challenges in medical image analysis, such as deep learning methods. It also discusses how these theories can be applied to a broad range of application areas, including lung and chest x-ray, breast CAD, microscopy and pathology. The studies included mainly focus on the detection of events from biomedical signals
