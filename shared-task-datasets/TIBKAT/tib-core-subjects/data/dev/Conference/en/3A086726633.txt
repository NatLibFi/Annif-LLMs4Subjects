Between culture and biology : perspectives on ontogenetic development
Between Culture and Biology brings together biological, psychological and cultural perspectives on development. It argues that the biological bases of behaviour and cultural context should be approached in an integrated fashion to properly understand ontogenetic development and that both the cultural and biological demain provide constraints and opportunities for development
