Computational Methods for Macromolecules: Challenges and Applications : Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Algorithms for Macromolecular Modeling, New York, October 12â€“14, 2000
This special volume collects invited articles by participants of the Third International Workshop on Methods for Macromolecular Modeling, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Oct. 12-14, 2000. Leading developers of methods for biomolecular simulations review advances in Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods, free energy computational methods, fast electrostatics (particle-mesh Ewald and fast multipole methods), mathematics, and molecular neurobiology, nucleic acid simulations, enzyme reactions, and other essential applications in biomolecular simulations. A Perspectives article by the editors assesses the directions and impact of macromolecular modeling research, including genomics and proteomics. These reviews and original papers by applied mathematicians, theoretical chemists, biomedical researchers, and physicists are of interest to interdisciplinary research students, developers and users of biomolecular methods in academia and industry
