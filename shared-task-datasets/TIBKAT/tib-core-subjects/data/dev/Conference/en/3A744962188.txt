Mechanics and Control : Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Control Mechanics in Honor of the 65th Birthday of George Leitmann January 22-24, 1990, University of Southern California
The three Workshops on Control Mechanics held annually since 1988 at the University of Southern California made substantial contribution to the above set of topics and have established a tradition in the interface between mechanics and control. The Workshop gained considerable international significance, with participants coming from USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Sweden, France, Germany and USSR. This Volume is also special by producing papers dedicated to G. Leitmann, one of the founders of the study on dynamics of uncertain systems, and thus emphasising this recently rapidly developing discipline. The three major sets of topics presented deal successively with the general control theory of uncertain systems, with new theoretic methods in control, and with applications to control of robotic manipulators, aircraft control and flexible structures, all well integrated
