Environmental Forensics : proceedings of the 2011 INEF conference [held at St. John's College in Cambridge, July 25th to the 27th, 2011]
This publication includes peer-reviewed manuscripts from the 2011 International Network of Environmental Forensics (INEF) Conference held at St. John's College in Cambridge, UK. INEF is an organization founded by environmental forensic scientists for the express purpose of sharing and disseminating environmental forensic information to the international scientific community. Environmental forensic information presented at this conference included topics on contaminant age dating, the use of chemical and biological diagnostic markers for contaminant source identification, advancements in the use of petroleum hydrocarbon pattern recognition techniques, the availability of surrogate chemicals to identify the age of a contaminant release, the identification and application of chemical impurities for source identification and advancements in compound specific isotopic analysis, especially related to chlorinated solvent releases. All of these topics were presented in terms of their applications in contaminant releases throughout the world in terrestrial and marine environments. This professionally edited book is the second of a series of INEF conference publications chronicling the current state of the art in environmental forensics. The intent of this publication and subsequent INEF conference volumes is to capture the evolution of environmental forensic topics as a scientific discipline.
