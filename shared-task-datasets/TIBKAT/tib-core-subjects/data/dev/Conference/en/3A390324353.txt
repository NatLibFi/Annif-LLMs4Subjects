Harmonic analysis, signal processing, and complexity : Festschrift in honor of the 60th birthday of Carlos A. Berenstein
Carlos A. Berenstein has had a profound influence on scholars and practitioners alike amid a distinguished mathematical career spanning nearly four decades. His uncommon capability of adroitly moving between these parallel worlds is demonstrated by the breadth of his research interests, from his early theoretical work on interpolation in spaces of entire functions with growth conditions and residue theory to his later work on deconvolution and its applications to issues ranging from optics to the study of blood flow. This volume, which celebrates his sixtieth birthday,reflects the state-of-the-art in these areas.Original articles and survey articles, all refereed, cover topics inharmonic and complex analysis, as well as more applied work in signal processing.
