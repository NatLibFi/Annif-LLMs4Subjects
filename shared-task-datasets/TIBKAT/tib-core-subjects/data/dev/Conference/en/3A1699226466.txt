"Recent advancements in generation of intense X-ray laser ultrashort pulses open opportunities for particle acceleration in solid-state plasmas. Wakefield acceleration in crystals or carbon nanotubes shows promise of unmatched ultra-high accelerating gradients and possibility to shape the future of high energy physics colliders. This book summarizes the discussions of the "Workshop on Beam Acceleration in Crystals and Nanostructures" (Fermilab, June 24-25 , 2019), presents next steps in theory and modeling and outlines major physics and technology challenges toward proof-of-principle demonstration experiments"--
