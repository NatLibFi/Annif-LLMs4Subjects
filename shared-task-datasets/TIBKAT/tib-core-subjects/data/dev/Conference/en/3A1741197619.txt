Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements - Mairepav9
This book gathers the proceedings of an international conference held at Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for materials Science and Technology) in DÃ¼bendorf, Switzerland, in July 2020. The conference series was established by the International Society of Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Transport Infrastructure (iSMARTi) for promoting and discussing state-of-the-art design, maintenance, rehabilitation and management of pavements. The inaugural conference was held at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2000. The series has steadily grown over the past 20 years, with installments hosted in various countries all over the world. The respective contributions share the latest insights from research and practice in the maintenance and rehabilitation of pavements, and discuss advanced materials, technologies and solutions for achieving an even more sustainable and environmentally friendly infrastructure. .
