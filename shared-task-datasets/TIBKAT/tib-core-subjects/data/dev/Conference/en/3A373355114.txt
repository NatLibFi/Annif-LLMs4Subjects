Noncommutative geometry : lectures given at the C.I.M.E. Summer School held in Martina Franca, Italy, September 3 - 9, 2000
Noncommutative Geometry is one of the most deep and vital research subjects of present-day Mathematics. Its development, mainly due to Alain Connes, is providing an increasing number of applications and deeper insights for instance in Foliations, K- Theory, Index Theory, Number Theory but also in Quantum Physics of elementary particles. The purpose of the Summer School in Martina Franca was to offer a fresh invitation to the subject and closely related topics; the contributions in this volume include the four main lectures, cover advanced developments and are delivered by prominent specialists. TOC:Preface.- A. Connes: Cyclic Cohomology, NoncommutativeGeometry and Quantum Group symmetries.- J. Cuntz: Cyclic Theory and the Bivariant Chern-Connes Character.- N. Higson, E. Guentner: Group C*-Algebras and K-Theory.- E. Guentner, J. Kaminker: Geometric and Analytic Properties ofGroups.- J. E. Roberts: More Lectures on Algebraic Quantum Field Theory
