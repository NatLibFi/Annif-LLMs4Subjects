Control Problems for Systems Described by Partial Differential Equations and Applications : Proceedings of the IFIP-WG 7.2 Working Conference Gainesville, Florida, February 3-6, 1986
This volume comprises the Proceedings of the IFIP 7/2 Conference on Control Problems for Systems Described by Partial Differential Equations and Applications held at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida in February 1987. The papers presented in this volume encompass several main directions of current research in the area including optimal control for variational inequalities, free boundary value problems, shape optimization, pareto-control, stabilization and controllability of hyperbolic equations, control problems for large space flexible structures, identification and estimation of distributed parameter systems, and numerical methods for control problems
