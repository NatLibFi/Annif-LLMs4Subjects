Modern problems of molecular physics : selected reviews from the 7th International Conference "Physics of Liquid Matter: Modern Problems", Kyiv, Ukraine, May 27-31, 2016
This book presents a collection of selected lectures discussing current problems in molecular physics and reviews the main cutting-edge advances in condensed and soft matter physics. It offers deep insights and a powerful basis for scientists and engineers to study complicated problems in physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. The unification of experimental, theoretical, and computational methods allows milestone results to be achieved in areas such as ionic and ionic-electronic liquids, magnetic liquid systems, liquid systems with nanoparticles, structural phase transitions and critical phenomena, and small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering in liquids and liquid systems.   The lectures selected for this book were held at the 7th International Conference "Physics of Liquid Matter: Modern Problems" (PLMMP-2016), 27-31 May in Kiev, Ukraine
