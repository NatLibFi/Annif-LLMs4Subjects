This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 9th Conference on Computability in Europe, CiE 2013, held in Milan, Italy, in July 2013. The 48 revised papers presented together with 1 invited lecture and 2 tutorials were carefully reviewed and selected with an acceptance rate of under 31,7%. Both the conference series and the association promote the development of computability-related science, ranging over mathematics, computer science and applications in various natural and engineering sciences such as physics and biology, and also including the promotion of related non-scientific fields such as philosophy and history of computing.--
