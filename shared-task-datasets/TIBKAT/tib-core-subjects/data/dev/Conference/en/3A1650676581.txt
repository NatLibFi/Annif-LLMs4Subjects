Ruthenate and Rutheno-Cuprate Materials : Unconventional Superconductivity, Magnetism and Quantum Phase Transitions
Ruthenate materials have come into focus recently because of their very interesting magnetic and superconducting properties. From the first international conference on this topic, the present volume has emerged as a first coherent account of the considerable body of work, both theoretical and experimental, gathered in this field within a short time span. The book has been written in the form of a set of lectures and tutorial reviews with the aim of providing the research community with both a comprehensive and modern source of reference and a tutorial introduction for postgraduate students and nonspecialists working in related areas
