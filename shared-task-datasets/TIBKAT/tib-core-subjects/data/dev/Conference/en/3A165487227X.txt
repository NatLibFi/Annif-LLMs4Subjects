This volume collects recent contributions on the contemporary trends in the mathematics of quantum mechanics, and more specifically in mathematical problems arising in quantum many-body dynamics, quantum graph theory, cold atoms, unitary gases, with particular emphasis on the developments of the specific mathematical tools needed, including: linear and non-linear Schrödinger equations, topological invariants, non-commutative geometry, resonances and operator extension theory, among others. Most of contributors are international leading experts or respected young researchers in mathematical physics, PDE, and operator theory. All their material is the fruit of recent studies that have already become a reference in the community. Offering a unified perspective of the mathematics of quantum mechanics, it is a valuable resource for researchers in the field
