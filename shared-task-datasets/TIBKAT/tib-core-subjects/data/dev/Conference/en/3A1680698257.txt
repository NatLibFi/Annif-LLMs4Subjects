Souto de Moura. Memory, projects, works
I look beyond solution; I look for an expression."-Eduardo Souto de Moura. The architect Eduardo Souto de Moura (b. 1952) has won many accolades, including the 2011 Pritzker Architecture Prize. Based in Porto, Souto de Moura studied under Fernando Tavora and worked under fellow Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza, with whom he continues to collaborate. Souto de Moura established his own practice in 1980, and his wide-ranging influences, including Mies van der Rohe and Donald Judd, can be seen in the stunning variety of his work, from his acclaimed private houses, to the striking Paula Rego Museum in Cascais and the Braga Municipal Stadium, to his work in historical contexts such as the Convento das Bernardas in Tavira. This beautifully illustrated retrospective provides the most comprehensive account of Souto de Moura's career to date. Drawings, notes and sketches from his archive, and newly commissioned photographs complement essays by scholars and prominent architects that trace Souto de Moura's career, contextualize his work within the larger trends of contemporary international architectural culture, and highlight the originality of his design strategy
