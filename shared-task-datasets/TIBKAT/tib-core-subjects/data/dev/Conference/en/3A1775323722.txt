This volume collects the edited and reviewed contribution presented in the 9th iTi Conference that took place virtually, covering fundamental and applied aspects in turbulence. In the spirit of the iTi conference, the volume is produced after the conference so that the authors had the opportunity to incorporate comments and discussions raised during the meeting. In the present book, the contributions have been structured according to the topics: I Experiments II Simulations and Modelling III Data Processing and Scaling IV Theory V Miscellaneous topics.
