Legal knowledge and information systems : JURIX 2021 : the Thirty-Fourth Annual Conference, Vilnius, Lithuania, 8-10 December 2021
"Traditionally concerned with computational models of legal reasoning and the analysis of legal data, the field of legal knowledge and information systems has seen increasing interest in the application of data analytics and machine learning tools to legal tasks in recent years. This book presents the proceedings of the 34th annual JURIX conference, which, due to pandemic restrictions, was hosted online in a virtual format from 8 - 10 December 2021 in Vilnius, Lithuania. Since its inception as a mainly Dutch event, the JURIX conference has become truly international and now, as a platform for the exchange of knowledge between theoretical research and applications, attracts academics, legal practitioners, software companies, governmental agencies and judiciary from around the world. A total of 65 submissions were received for this edition, and after rigorous review, 14 of these were selected for publication as full papers and 17 as short papers, representing an overall acceptance rate of 47%. The papers are divided into 6 sections: visualization and legal informatics; knowledge representation and data analytics; logical and conceptual representations; predictive models; explainable artificial intelligence; and legal ethics, and cover a wide range of topics, from computational models of legal argumentation, case-based reasoning, legal ontologies, smart contracts, privacy management and evidential reasoning, through information extraction from different types of text in legal documents, to ethical dilemmas. Providing an overview of recent advances and the cross-fertilization between law and computing technologies, this book will be of interest to all those working at the interface between technology and law"--
