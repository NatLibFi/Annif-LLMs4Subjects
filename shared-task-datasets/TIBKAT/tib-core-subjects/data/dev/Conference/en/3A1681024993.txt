Basic concepts in nuclear physics: Theory, experiments and applications : 2018 La Rábida International Scientific Meeting on Nuclear Physics
Preface -- Nuclear reaction experiments -- Experimental techniques for mass spectroscopy -- Shell model -- Neutrino physics and NEXT experiment -- Medical image processing, treatment planning, PET applications -- Nuclear reaction theory
This book features material presented at the La Rábida 2018 International Scientific Meeting on Nuclear Physics, which was based on a well-known series of triennial international summer schools on Nuclear Physics organized from 1982 to 2003 by the Basic Nuclear Physics group at the University of Seville and latter, from 2009 to 2018, by the University of Seville and the University of Huelva. The meeting offered graduate students and young researchers a broad overview of the field of nuclear physics. The book includes contributions from invited speakers on topics such as a state-of-the-art nuclear shell model and selected aspects of mass spectroscopy. Other chapters present an introduction to shell model, a review of experimental nuclear reactions, a discussion of the theory of nuclear reactions and an overview of nuclear medicine. Further, the posters and seminars presented by students offer fresh perspectives on various problems current in nuclear physics
