BC architects & studies - The act of building
From the first field trips for the design of a library in Burundi to involving over 150 workshop participants in the construction of a public building in Belgium, the stories compiled in this book tell how BC architects & studies engage in acts of building. BC believes that, in order to have a positive impact on our society, architects need to intervene beyond the narrow definition of the professional who designs and controls the execution of buildings. Hence, BC ventures into material production, contracting, storytelling, knowledge transfer, community organization, which influence their design approach.0By describing the way BC architects & studies design and perform the act of building, the book suggests a trajectory of how BC hopes architecture can contribute to our world in transition.00Exhibition: Belgian Pavilion, 16th Architecture Biennale, Venice, Italy (26.05.-25.11.2018)
