The effect of groundwater on benthic primary producers and their interaction
In littoral zones of lakes, multiple processes determine lake ecology and water quality. Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD), most frequently taking place in littoral zones, can transport or mobilize nutrients from the sediments and thus contribute significantly to lake eutrophication. Furthermore, lake littoral zones are the habitat of benthic primary producers, namely submerged macrophytes and periphyton, which play a key role in lake food webs and influence lake water quality. Groundwater-mediated nutrient-influx can potentially affect the asymmetric competition between submerged macrophytes and periphyton for light and nutrients. While rooted macrophytes have superior access to sediment nutrients, periphyton can negatively affect macrophytes by shading. LGD may thus facilitate periphyton production at the expense of macrophyte production, although studies on this hypothesized effect are missing. The research presented in this thesis is aimed at determining how LGD influences periphyton, macrophytes, and the interactions ...
