Studies of Nanoconstrictions, Nanowires and Fe3 O4 Thin Films : Electrical Conduction and Magnetic Properties. Fabrication by Focused Electron/Ion Beam
This work constitutes a detailed study of electrical and magnetic properties in nanometric materials with a range of scales: atomic-sized nanoconstrictions, micro- and nanowires and thin films. Firstly, a novel method of fabricating atomic-sized constrictions in metals is presented; it relies on measuring the conduction of the device while a focused-ion-beam etching process is in progress.
This work constitutes a detailed study of electrical and magnetic properties in nanometric materials with a range of scales: atomic-sized nanoconstrictions, micro- and nanowires and thin films. Firstly, a novel method of fabricating atomic-sized constrictions in metals is presented, it relies on measuring the conduction of the device while a focused-ion-beam etching process is in progress. Secondly, it describes wires created by a very promising nanolithography technique: Focused electron/ion-beam-induced deposition. Three different gas precursors were used: (CH3)3Pt(CpCH3), W(CO)6 and Co2(CO)8. The thesis reports the results obtained for various physical phenomena: the metal-insulator transition, superconducting and magnetic properties, respectively. Finally, the detailed magnetotransport properties in epitaxial Fe3O4 thin films grown on MgO (001) are presented. Overall, the new approaches developed in this thesis have great potential for supporting novel technologies.
