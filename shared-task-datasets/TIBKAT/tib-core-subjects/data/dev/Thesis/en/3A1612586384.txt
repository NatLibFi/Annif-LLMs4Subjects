Die Vertextung der Welt : Forschungsreisen als Literatur bei Georg Forster, Alexander von Humboldt und Adelbert von Chamisso
This study examines the literary presentation of research expeditions, comparing the works of Forster, von Humboldt, and Chamisso. The first part looks at third-party portrayals of expeditionary goals, while the second part focuses on the natural scientists' own presentations. In addition to facilitating new perspectives on texts that have been researched before, this work, thanks to its novel methodology, spotlights new horizons for travel research. -- Publisher
