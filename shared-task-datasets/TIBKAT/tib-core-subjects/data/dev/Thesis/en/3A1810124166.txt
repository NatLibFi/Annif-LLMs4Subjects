Unraveling property-performance relationships in CO2 hydrogenation over iron-based catalysts
This thesis deals with the development of iron-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and understanding of fundamentals relevant for activity and selectivity. The most decisive factors affecting activity and selectivity were identified by statistical approaches. The promotion effects of alkali metal promoter on CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-based catalysts were elucidated through characterization and kinetic analyses. This thesis also contributes to understanding of the interplay between physicochemical properties of promoter-free Fe-based catalyst and catalytic performance.<eng>
