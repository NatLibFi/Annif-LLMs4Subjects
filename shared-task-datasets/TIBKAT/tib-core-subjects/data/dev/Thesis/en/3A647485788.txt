Mass spectrometry based proteomics approaches unraveling dynamic processes in the entire bacterial cell
Deciphering the entire protein complement of a living cell together with the elucidation of dynamic processes on protein level are the main goals of proteomics as it is used today. To achieve this goal, namely the elucidation of dynamic processes of the entire bacterial cell, we have developed strategies and distinct workflows to cover the most proteins in different subcellular localizations in bacteria together with a stable isotopes labeling approach to follow temporal and spatial changes in different proteomic subfractions. In this work, it has been shown that the use of mass spectrometry based in vivo quantitation techniques and the application of subcellular and chromatographic fractionation has lead to a new level of qualitative and quantitative proteomics data. Emphasizing on the studies revealing the dynamics of the bacterial physiology on a time resolved base, both spatial and temporal processes can be monitored to obtain knowledge on physiological processes in a depth that has not been reached before in comparable global studies.
