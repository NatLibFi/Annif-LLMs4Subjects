Interpretation von FCKW-Datensätzen im Weddellmeer
Regionale Ozeanographie, Antarktis, FCKW, CFC, Wassermassen, thermohaline Zirkulation,AABW. - The aim of this thesis is to generate a circulation scheme of the deep water masses of the Weddell Sea with the primary objective to estimate production rates of different sources of these water masses using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data. Repeated observations of CFC for a section along the Prime Meridian from Antarctica (70ʿS) to approximately 50ʿS are presented for the period 1984 - 1998. In addition CFC data from the Weddell Sea section (Kapp Norvegia - Joinville Island) are considered. For various CFC features at this sections CFC time series have been generated, in particular for two deep cores of CFC-11 maxima adjoining the southern and northern margins of the Weddell Basin and elevated CFC concentrations over the Middle Atlantic Ridge. A new method ...
