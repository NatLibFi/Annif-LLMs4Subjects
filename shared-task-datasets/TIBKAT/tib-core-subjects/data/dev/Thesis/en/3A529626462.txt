Magneto-structural characterization of polynuclear complexes with supramolecular architectures
The thesis describes the supramolecular organization of homo- and heteropolynuclear complexes, containing different paramagnetic centers, going from d-block metal ions to combination of d-f spin carriers topologies. These polynuclear complexes have been structurally and spectroscopically characterized, and partly magnetostructural correlations have been performed. The synthesis of polynuclear complexes has been based on self-assembly and rational strategies. Iron(iii) aza-crown complexes have been isolated through self-assembly reaction between N-imidazol-2-yl-salicyloyl hydrazide and FeX3·xH2O salts in presence of pseudo-halide coligands. These complexes are characterized by antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe(iii) centers. In addition, self-assembly of easy accessible Schiff base ligands and d-block metal salts led to homo-polynuclear d-complexes with the magnetic interaction varying from strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic centers to ferromagnetic interaction induced by accidental orthogonality of the magnetic orbitals associated to d-metal ions in partial-cubane structural core. The rational strategy approach is divided in two subcategories, namely the dendritic approach and ʺcomplex-as-ligandʺ strategy. The dendritic approach is based upon C3-symmetric triaminoguanidine-Schiff base ligand derivatives which present three-fold tridentate coordination pockets.
