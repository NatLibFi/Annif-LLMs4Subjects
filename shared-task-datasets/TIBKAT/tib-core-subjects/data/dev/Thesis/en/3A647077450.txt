Domino twofold Heck - 6Ï€-electrocyclization and regioselective palladium(0)-catalyzed reactions of brominated indoles, furans, naphthoquinone and 2,4,5,6-tetrachloropyrimidine
I have synthesized functionalized carbazoles and benzofurans based on domino twofold Heck / 6pi-electrocyclization reactions. Functionalized anthraquinones, fluorenones and benzocoumarines were also prepared by this methodology. Regioselctive Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of 2,4,5,6-tetrachloropyrimidine and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromofuran provided an expedient synthesis of mono-, di-, tri- and tetraaryl-pyrimidines and di- and tetraarylfurans.
