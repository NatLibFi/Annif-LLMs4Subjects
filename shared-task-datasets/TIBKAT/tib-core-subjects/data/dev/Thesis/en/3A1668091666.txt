Utilization of graphitic carbon nitride in dispersed media
Utilization of sunlight for energy harvesting has been foreseen as sustainable replacement for fossil fuels, which would also eliminate side effects arising from fossil fuel consumption such as drastic increase of CO2 in Earth atmosphere. Semiconductor materials can be implemented for energy harvesting, and design of ideal energy harvesting devices relies on effective semiconductor with low recombination rate, ease of processing, stability over long period, non-toxicity and synthesis from abundant sources. Aforementioned criteria have attracted broad interest for graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) materials, metal-free semiconductor which can be synthesized from low cost and abundant precursors. Furthermore, physical properties such as band gap, surface area and absorption can be tuned. g-CN was investigated as heterogeneous catalyst, with diversified applications from water splitting to CO2 reduction and organic coupling reactions. However, low dispersibility of g-CN in water and organic solvents was an obstacle for future improvements. ...
