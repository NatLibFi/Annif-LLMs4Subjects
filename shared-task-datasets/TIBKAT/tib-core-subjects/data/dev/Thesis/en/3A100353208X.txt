Advanced x-ray multilayer waveguide optics
The aim of this thesis was to design novel waveguide structures, and to analyze them in view of complex phenomena of near-field propagation. For this purpose, experimental far-field measurements were used in combination with finite-difference simulations and phase retrieval methods. Two novel structures have been designed, fabricated and characterized: the waveguide array (WGA), yielding several waveguided beams in transmission, and multi-guide resonate beam couplers (RBCs), tailored to yield two or several reflected beams. Two novel structures have been designed, fabricated and characterized: the WGA, yielding several waveguided beams in transmission, and multi-guide RBCs, tailored to yield two or several reflected beams. The WGA and the multi-guide RBCs are not only distinct in the coupling geometry. A major difference is related to the fact that the WGA principle is based on the separation (non coupling) of the different transmitted wavelets, while the RBC functions are based on a strong coupling of guided radiation in several layers.
