Bifurcation analysis of microscopic follow-the-leader traffic models
Traffic flow is an interesting phenomenon of our modern world. Although we all experience it daily, tra±c ʿow is far from being well understood. It is a life science problem, since drivers do not usually act according to well defined rules. However, the increase of tra±c in many areas and the related problems underline the importance of a realistic description of traffic flow or of some of its features. The mathematical modeling of traffic flow has a long tradition. Various approaches can be found in literature. A very common class of tra±c models is the macroscopic one, where the traffic flow is described in terms of density and velocity distributions ...
