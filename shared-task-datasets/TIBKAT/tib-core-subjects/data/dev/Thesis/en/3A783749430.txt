Immune-modulatory effects of non-thermal plasma
Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has drawn more and more attention to the field of wound healing research during the last two decades. It is characterized by a unique composition, which includes amongst others free radicals, ions and electrons. Furthermore, non-thermal plasma exhibits temperatures that are below those inducing thermal cell damage. Next to its well-established anti-bacterial properties, plasma can have lethal as well as stimulating effects on mammalian cells. Therefore, the medical application of non-thermal plasma on chronic wounds seems to be a promising tool to enable healing processes. However, less is known about the plasma-mediated induction of intracellular signaling pathways in human immune cells, which play a leading part in the process of wound recovery and removal of pathogens. Therefore, this thesis examined the cellular effects of a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on human immune cells using the argon plasma jet kinpen 09. Here, the CD4+ T helper cell line Jurkat, the monocyte cell line THP-1 as well as the corresponding primary cells were investigated. First, cell survival and apoptosis induction was assessed in response to non-thermal plasma treatment by growth curves and flow cytometric assays. On the one hand it could be shown that primary cells are more susceptible to plasma treatment than the respective cell lines. On the other hand, monocytes responded less sensitive to plasma exposure than lymphocytes. Furthermore ...
