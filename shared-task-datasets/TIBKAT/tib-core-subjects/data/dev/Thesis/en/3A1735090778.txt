Light-induced pH cycle : a non-invasive method to control biochemical reactions
Background Many biochemical reactions depend on the pH of their environment and some are strongly accelerated in an acidic surrounding. A classical approach to control biochemical reactions non-invasivly is by changing the temperature. However, if the pH could be controlled by optical means using photo-active chemicals, this would mean to be able to accelerate suitable biochemical reactions. Optically switching the pH can be achieved by using photoacids. A photoacid is a molecule with a functional group that releases a proton upon irradiation with the suitable wavelength, acidifying the environmental aqueous surrounding. A major goal of this work was to establish a non-invasive method of optically controlling the pH in aqueous solutions, offering the opportunity to enhance the known chemical reactions portfolio. To demonstrate the photo-switchable pH cycling we chose an enzymatic assay using acid phosphatase, which is an enzyme with a strong pH dependent activity. Results In this work we could demonstrate a light-induced, reversible ...
