Construction of six functor formalisms
Abstract: In this thesis we construct a model structure on the category of unbounded chain complexes of O-modules for any small ringed site (X,O). This uses the theory of cotorsion pairs. We then show that the four functors - pullback and pushforward, and tensor product and internal hom - are simultaneously Quillen adjunctions. <br>We will then restrict to the case of certain topological spaces, and use this model structure to construct a six functor formalism in the sense of HÃ¶rmann, i.e. we additionally construct proper pushforward and exceptional pullback functors. These functors are well-known, as are many comparision isomorphisms. However the construction we use clarifies all compatibilities between those isomorphisms.<br>To use the construction given in we define a compactification structure on a subcategory of topological spaces and establish various, well-known, base change formulas
