Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for the identification of aminopyrene trisulfonic acid labeled glycans
The aim of this work was the development of capillary-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (CE-MS) methods with high separation power for the characterization of aminopyrene-trisulfonic acid (APTS)-labeled glycans. State of the art for routine glycan analysis is capillary sieving electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (CSE-LIF) using the fluorescent APTS. However, a firsthand identification of glycans is not possible. This thesis presents two high performance CE-MS methods, with appropriate separation efficiency (i.e. resolution of structural isomers) for biopharmaceutical samples. The first method uses a novel alkaline background electrolyte (BGE) for the simultaneous analysis of APTS-labeled as well as charged native glycans. The alkaline BGE enables a robust CE-MS application and the determination of derivatization and ionization efficiency. The glycans of several different types of biopharmaceutically relevant proteins could be identified. ...
