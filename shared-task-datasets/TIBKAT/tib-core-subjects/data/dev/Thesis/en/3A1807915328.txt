Optimization of multicore optical fibers with fiber Bragg gratings towards bend and shape sensing
A shape sensor based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in multicore fibers is a complex device with multiple factors which have to be accounted for a successful measure- ment system. In this dissertation, I considered several aspects of such shape and curvature sensors.
