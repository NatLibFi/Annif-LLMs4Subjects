Time-Symmetry Breaking in Turbulent Multi-Particle Dispersion
In fluid dynamics, the term turbulence usually describes a special state of a continuous medium in which many interacting degrees of freedom are excited. Turbulent flows therefore exhibit strong temporal and spatial fluctuations in velocity, pressure and other flow properties. This behavior can be found in the atmospheric flows that determine our weather and climate, water flows in rivers and oceans, and even in the coffee we drink and the air we breathe. One of the interesting phenomena observed in turbulent flows is their time irreversibility. When milk is stirred into coffee, for example...
