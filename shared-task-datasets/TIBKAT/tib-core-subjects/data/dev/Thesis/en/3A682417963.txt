Indoloquinoline-oligonucleotide conjugates in the antigene strategy : binding and NMR structural studies
Triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are one of the most specific DNA duplex binding agents and offer new perspectives towards oligonucleotide-mediated gene regulation and manipulation. However, the poor thermodynamic stability of DNA triplexes under physiological conditions limits a successful application in the antigene strategy. Thus, the conjugation of TFOs with small triplex-specific binding ligands is a promising approach to stabilize the formed complexes and to enhance their overall binding affinity. The present study focused on the synthesis of novel TFO conjugates with triplex-binding indolo[3,2-b]quinoline derivatives (PIQ) and on their ability to form and stabilize intermolecular triplexes through their recognition of a duplex target. During the course of the work the thermodynamics of conjugate binding and structural aspects of drug-DNA interactions have been characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques.
