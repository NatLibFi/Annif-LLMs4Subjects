Influence of river reconstruction at a bank filtration site : water quality field investigation and 3D modelling of groundwater flow and heat transport
Bank filtration is an effective water treatment technique and is widely adopted in Europe along major rivers. It is the process where surface water penetrates the riverbed, flows through the aquifer, and then is extracted by near-bank production wells. By flowing in the subsurface flow passage, the water quality can be improved by a series of beneficial processes. Long-term riverbank filtration also produces colmation layers on the riverbed. The colmation layer may act as a bioactive zone that is governed by biochemical and physical processes owing to its enrichment of microbes and organic matter. Low permeability may strongly limit the surface water infiltration and further lead to a decreasing recoverable ratio of production wells.The removal of the colmation layer is therefore a trade-off between the treatment capacity and treatment efficiency. The goal of this Ph.D. thesis is to focus on the temporal and spatial change of the water quality and quantity along the flow path of a hydrogeological heterogeneous riverbank filtration ...
