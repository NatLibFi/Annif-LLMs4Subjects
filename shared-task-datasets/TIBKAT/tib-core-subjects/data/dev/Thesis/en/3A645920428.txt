Ecological management of tropical forests: implications for climate change and carbon fluxes
Tropical deforestation and forest degradation contributes to more than 20% of the global greenhouse gases emitted. Deforestation and its impacts can be more easily estimated with satellite images. Concerning forest degradation, it is difficult with the actual satellite image resolutions to evaluate accurately logging and biomass damage resulting from this activity though it contributes substantially to carbon emissions in the tropics. With increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, there is an urgent need of reliable biomass estimates and carbon pools in tropical forests, most especially in Africa where there is a serious lack of data. Moist tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to a broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa. Developing site-specific equations and pan-moist tropical equations including data from Africa is becoming very important for most ecologists for accurate estimations of this contribution extend, necessary for adaptation and mitigation strategies on climate change impacts. Allometric equations are key tools for climate change scenarios since they are used for estimating biomass and carbon pool at local, regional and world level. Information on net primary production (NPP) resulting from direct biomass field measurements of annual tree ring width is crucial in this context, to know how forest ecosystems will grow in the future with their possible impacts on carbon pools and fluxes and also to calibrate eddy covariance measurements ...
