A grid-adaptive algebraic hybrid RANS/LES method
The present thesis considers the compressible Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the flow of air about basic and complex test cases. As numerical solution method the unstructured finite-volume solver DLR-TAU is used. The aim of the work is to provide a hybrid RANS/LES simulation strategy for the reliable numerical prediction of the stall behavior of high-lift airfoils under the influence of turbulent inflow. The Algebraic Delayed DES (ADDES) is extended, improved, and validated for several fundamental flow cases and application challenges. In the ADDES the distinction between RANS and LES ...
