Controlling light emission by dielectric metasurfaces
The dielectric metasurfaces have been widely recognized as a low-loss platform allowing for manipulation of the near- and far-fields. However, the field of light-emitting dielectric metasurfaces is less developed. The main objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how dielectric metasurfaces can improve and control the emission of nanoscale light sources coupled to them. This includes the experimental realization of coupled photonic systems consisting of emitters and dielectric metasurfaces, development of optical setups for characterization of the emission properties, and numerical simulations to support the experimental data and to analyze the underlying physical mechanisms.
