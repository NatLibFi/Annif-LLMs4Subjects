Matching events and activities : preprocessing event logs for process analysis
Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during process execution. Aiming at a better process understanding and improvement, this event data can be used to analyze processes using process mining techniques. Process models can be automatically discovered and the execution can be checked for conformance to specified behavior. Moreover, existing process models can be enhanced and annotated with valuable information, for example for performance analysis. While the maturity of process mining algorithms is increasing and more tools are entering the market, process mining projects still face the problem of different levels of abstraction when comparing events with modeled business activities. Mapping the recorded events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process discovery results. Current approaches try to abstract from events in an automated way that does not capture the required domain knowledgâ€¦
