Applied fuzzy arithmetic : an introduction with engineering applications
"Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic" provides a well-structured compendium that offers both a deeper knowledge about the theory of fuzzy arithmetic and an extensive view on its applications in the engineering sciences, making it a resource for students, researchers, and practical engineers. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the theory of fuzzy arithmetic, which aims to present the subject in a well-organized and comprehensible form. The derivation of fuzzy arithmetic from the original fuzzy set theory and its evolution towards a successful implementation is presented with existing formulations of fuzzy arithmetic included and integrated in the overall context. The second part of the book presents a diversified exposition of the application of fuzzy arithmetic, addressing different areas of the engineering sciences, such as mechanical, geotechnical, biomedical, and control engineering. TOC:Part1 Introduction to Fuzzy Arithmetic.- The Theory of Fuzzy Sets.- Elementary Fuzzy Arithmetic.- Standard Fuzzy Arithmetic.- Advanced Fuzzy Arithmetic- The Transformation Method.- Additions to Fuzzy Arithmetic.- Part 2 Applications in the Engineering Sciences.- Mechanical Engineering.- Geotechnical Engineering.- Biomedical Engineering.- Control Engineering
