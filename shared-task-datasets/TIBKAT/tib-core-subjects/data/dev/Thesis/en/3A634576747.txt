Performance studies for the KM3NeT neutrino telescope
KM3NeT is a future neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea with an instrumented volume of a few cubic kilometres. The aim of the project is to detect cosmic neutrinos from sources like supernova remnants. To optimise the sensitivity while adhering to a given budget, detailed Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed, varying different detector parameters. The main focus was on a new detector design, which could not be studied in full detail before because of the lack of dedicated simulation and reconstruction tools. The work presents new tools and algorithms developed specifically for this new design. The results generated using these tools are presented and the sensitivity of KM3NeT to different source fluxes is discussed.
