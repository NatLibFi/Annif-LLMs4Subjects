Characterization of NiP layers and alternative coating systems as wear and corrosion protection on aluminum alloy castings ¤ Piston rings in exhaust gas turbochargers are currently manufactured from the high-temperature-resistant aluminum alloy EN AW 2618A. However, due to the reasons of wear and corrosion protection, these must be coated additionally in engines with low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation. The used nickel-phosphorus layers have a significant impact on the dynamic load-bearing capacity. The goal of this dissertation is therefore to first reproduce the loads of the piston ring in suitable tests and secondly to create a comparable data basis for various piston ring base materials and coatings. The loads of the piston ring are reproduced here in tensile fatigue tests, various corrosion tests, by cavitation and thermal aging. The investigated base materials are the currently used material EN AW 2618A and an alternative alloy AA 2055. As possible coatings, nickel-phosphorus layers and plasma-chemical aluminum oxide layers are investigated. In the comparison of the two base materials, it shows that the alternative material is superior to the currently used material in terms of dynamic load-bearing capacity and wear resistance. However, corrosion and aging resistance are lower. In the two coating variants, the nickel-phosphorus layers show the best variant in terms of wear and corrosion resistance. However, the lifespan of the layers is lower compared to the plasma-chemical aluminum oxide layers. By adjusting the nickel-phosphorus layers appropriately, the lifespan can be increased to a level significantly higher than that of the plasma-chemical aluminum oxide layers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1125389400> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316091-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172243-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005996-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187964-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078787-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163525-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032522-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185123-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001590-7>

Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Phase Change Materials for Reducing High Summer Room Temperatures ¤ Modern office architecture with rooms in lightweight construction and large transparent façade elements exacerbates the problem of summer overheating in buildings in conjunction with high internal loads. Phase change materials (PCM: phase change materials) offer an interesting opportunity to reduce summer overheating in buildings without elaborate equipment technology such as air conditioning. The thermal comfort in rooms equipped with a PCM paint can be significantly increased. The work investigates the application possibilities and optimization potential of a PCM paint on an experimental and numerical basis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136674-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166862-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004910-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048584-5>
Integrated Usage Mining : A Method for Analyzing User Behavior in the Web ¤ How do users use websites? With established procedures, it has not been possible so far to find sufficiently detailed, objective, and representative answers to this. Kai Honsel closes this research gap with a new method: the integration of Web Usage Mining and Eye Tracking. In addition to the theory, the author describes the software-technical implementation and demonstrates the added value and efficiency of the procedure in a large-scale reference study.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122898-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4356308-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268365-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4596172-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4301487-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026663-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161353-3>
Investigations on Structure-Activity Relationships and the Mechanism of Action of Melleolid Antibiotics ¤ Melleolides, secondary metabolites from representatives of the Armillaria genus of Basidiomycetes, possess high bioactivity. The underlying phytotoxic, antifungal, antibacterial, and cytotoxic mechanisms have never been investigated. This work deals with structure-activity relationships and mechanisms of action of selected melleolid antibiotics. The target for antifungal activity was identified using a chemically synthesized probe based on dehydroarmillylorsellinat (DAO) in the model organism A. nidulans. The fungal, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF2) was found to be the target of DAO for antifungal activity and was confirmed by inhibition experiments with various yeasts using the known EF2 inhibitor sordarin as a reference substance. The mechanism of action of DAO could be transferred to further melleolides with a Δ2,4-unsaturated aldehyde in position C1. The assumption of different binding sites in the fungal EF2 protein could be simulated in silico at a model protein of the EF2 from A. nidulans, and thus a putative DAO binding site was identified. DAO interacts with human cells with 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme of the inflammation cascade. By a Michael addition based on the Δ2,4-unsaturated aldehyde, DAO selectively and irreversibly binds to cysteine 159 (C159) at the entrance of the catalytic center of 5-LO, thereby reducing leukotriene biosynthesis. The observed rapid cytotoxicity of human cancer cells and monocytes is based on another mechanism. The covalent binding of DAO to the head group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) causes an induced cell death due to a reduction in cell membrane permeability. Necrotic and apoptotic effects are the consequence. In this work, three completely different mechanisms of action of Δ2,4-unsaturated melleolides could be identified.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041418-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335042-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002257-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297318-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181854-4>

Adjoint Navier-Stokes methods for hydrodynamic shape optimisation ¤ To efficiently calculate the sensitivity derivative of hydrodynamic objective functionals with respect to the shape, the adjoint Navier-Stokes equations were derived analytically. Consistent adjoint discretisation schemes were developed term-wise from the primal finite-volume discretisation. The adjoint method, implemented in the framework of a general-purpose pressure-correction based RANS code for unstructured grids, was validated against analytical solutions and verified by means of the direct-differentiation method. The adjoint-based sensitivity derivative was computed to guide a manual re-design of a ship hull to improve the wake field. Moreover, automatic shape-optimisation runs were carried out to reduce the power loss for ducted flows.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198196-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041456-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329076-0>
Immunelectronmicroscopic Investigations of Lung Development with Epithelial and Mesenchymal Markers in Embryonic Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) ¤ In the study, structural and functional aspects of the embryonic development of the gas exchange tissue of the avian lung (using the example of the chicken) were investigated. The structural changes and developmental processes occurring during this time were examined using light microscopy on semi-thin sections, transmission electron microscopy on ultra-thin sections, and scanning electron microscopy.

Corner Strength Optimized (Further) Development of a Process for Separating Ultra-Thin Glass ¤ The use of glasses, particularly ultra-thin glasses, is limited in numerous innovative applications due to their brittle fracture behavior. In the present work, a new, production-capable corner strength measurement process for ultra-thin glass samples is described, compared with established strength testing procedures and found to be suitable for use. In the further course of the work, a corner strength optimized notch and fracture process for ultra-thin glass is developed through the construction of new machine components using a large number of tested samples and advanced statistical methods. Furthermore, it is proven that the resulting strength can be predicted using a linear model if a cutting fluid is used. Based on a large number of tested samples, it is then demonstrated that the resulting strength follows a 3-parameter Weibull distribution and therefore has a strength threshold below which the fracture probability is negligible from an engineering perspective. This enables product designers to develop innovative products that are based on a reliably high strength of ultra-thin glass and thus significantly expand the application range of glasses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052995-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133895-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1034881949> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4750975-2>
The Agglomeration Areas in the Federal Republic of Germany: Development, Re-definition, and Regional Load Analysis ¤ Cliff's Notes: The development of agglomeration areas is of great importance for society and the state. The prerequisite for the development of spatial planning concepts and programs are in-depth knowledge of the causes and development trends of the agglomeration process. These are therefore at the center of the first part of the investigation. Subsequently, an attempt is made to lay the foundations for a multi-level model for evaluating the negative consequences of regional agglomeration processes. This includes a problem-oriented concept for re-defining the agglomeration areas as well as a specific instrumentarium for intraregional load analysis. Both models are checked using test calculations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069106-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8>
Person Identification by Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings: Requirements for the Proper Conduct of Recognition Procedures and Evaluation of the Evidence Value of Identification Performances under Special Consideration of Forensic Psychological and Criminological Aspects ¤ Misidentifications by witnesses account for a significant proportion of the total number of judicial errors in German criminal proceedings. How can misidentifications occur? -- The recognition of a person as a previously perceived perpetrator is subject to an extremely complex cognitive process. The identification performance of witnesses can be impaired by a series of psychologically investigated influencing factors and is extremely error-prone. Nevertheless, person identification by witnesses in criminal proceedings often has a guiding significance. -- Anja Hofmann shows that the inherently error-prone recognition of persons can be made significantly more reliable by observing certain methodological procedures. She demands with emphasis that those responsible give sufficient attention to these forensic psychological and criminological findings and incorporate corresponding methods into police and judicial practice. -- The author not only offers a compact information opportunity, but also makes a contribution to reducing the error sources in person recognition and thus to solving the associated procedural, forensic psychological, and criminological problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067701-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072712-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116634-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033193-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058881-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134819-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177258-1>
Evaluation of the utilization of Common Reed (Phragmites australis) for local livelihood, biomass production and wetland restoration in Inner Mongolia, China ¤ Schilf, China, Inner Mongolia, Wetland, Paper, Reed, Renewable Energy, Biomass, Paludiculture, Common reed, paludiculture, wetland, paper, pulp Wetlands are often considered as wastelands as they cannot be used as regular farmlands, for which they are usually drained to turn them into agricultural land. Such a limited perspective on wetlands overlooks the multiple ecosystem services that wetlands provide for humans and nature. Some of those services are the storage and purification of water, provision of food and raw materials, regulation of local climate and using as a habitat. Many of such services are provided by nature for ’free’ and therefore have no monetary value on traditional markets. In the case of China, wetlands cover 8% of the total area but are in a serious threatening situation through there is some success in restoring parts of them in recent years. In the last 50 years more than 20% of Chinese wetlands got lost due to pollution, water diversion and dams, reclamation, drainage and over-exploitation resouces. Water resources and wetlands −especially in North and North-East of China, are under pressure as these are arid or semi-arid regions. Yet, wetlands provide important ecosystem services for aforementioned region and contribute significantly to local livelihood in many ways, for instance the provision of food and raw materials. The aim of this thesis was to make an assessment- in both economic and ecologic terms, of Common Reed (Phragmites australis) at Lake Wuliangsuhai, where reed can be found in large amounts and is locally relevant. Reed was investigated at a case study in Inner Mongolia, China ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184092-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044522-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179621-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016960-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006877-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179622-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>
School Policy in Cities with Student Decline: A Governance Analysis at the Example of Leipzig and Timişoara ¤ The Governance Approach as Analytical Perspective -- Historical-political Context of East Germany and Romania -- Dealing with Declining Student Numbers in Leipzig and Timişoara -- Governance Forms in Comparison -- Declining Student Numbers at the Interface of Education and Urban Policy. Anne Walde analyzes political negotiation processes in connection with declining student numbers in cities affected by demographic change and migration. At the example of Leipzig and the Romanian city of Timişoara, she examines the frequently controversially discussed decisions on school closures as well as the collision of opposing interests of parents, schools, politics, and administration. Using the Governance Perspective, the author shows that political decisions depend on the actors and their action possibilities against other actors and how this is presented in concrete terms on site.

The Use of Unusable Random Discoveries for Evidence Purposes in the Investigative Procedure of Criminal Procedure ¤ The study considers the regulations in §§ 161 II 1, 477 II 2 StPO. These regulations only allow the use of accidental discoveries as evidence in an investigation process if the primary investigative measure could hypothetically be disposed of in the new investigation. The key question of this study is to what extent the prohibition on using accidental discovery for evidence influences the use of that information for compulsory measures like searches and pre-trial custody.As far as the accidental information may be considered to substantiate the suspicion of having committed a crime, it is necessary to take into account the higher interference of the compulsory measure with the constitutional rights.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173908-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068192-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015326-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191194-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151298-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4250312-7>
Synthetic studies on Canangone and ß-Chamigrene ¤ The objective of this work was to synthesize the quaternary stereocenter containing spirocycles, (+)-Canangone and ß-Chamigrene. Michael acceptor was prepared in three steps. The Robinson annulation of enamino lactone and Michael acceptor followed by hydrolysis provided the spirolactone. Subsequent deprotection, Luche reduction and oxidation gave (R*,R*) Canangone and (5R*,6S*)-epi-Canangone. Following the same strategy, optically active (+)-Canangone and (-)-Canangone, and their epimers were synthesized. As a second target, the synthesis of ß-Chamigrene was attempted but unfortunately, attempts to synthesize the ß-Chamigrene precursor completely failed.An alternative route was proposed, in which ß-Chamigrene could be synthesized in only four steps. The Diels-Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone and isoprene gave acetyl cyclohexene and alkylation of this product using prenyl iodide provided the mono alkylated product but unfortunately, attempts to cyclize it failed completely to give the desired spirocyclic compound.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139067-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135603-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4385088-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121505-9>
Titanocenes bridged by azines in the oxidation states II and III ¤ Im Rahmen dieser Doktorarbeit wurden die Reaktivitäten von Titanocenen der Oxidationsstufen II und III gegenüber aromatischen N-Heterozyklen, wie beispielsweise 4,4`-Azobis(pyridin) und 4,4`-Bipyridin untersucht. Als Ausgangsstoffe dienen Titanocen(II)acteylenkomplexe sowie das [Cp2Ti(III)(THF)2][B(Ph)4]. So konnten eine Reihe von ein- und zweikernigen bis hin zu multinuklearen Komplexen isoliert und charakterisiert werden. Im Speziellen führt die Verwendung von permethylierten bzw. tert.-butylsubstituierten Cyclopentadienylliganden am Titanocen(II) in Reaktion mit 4,4`-Azobis(pyridin) zur Bildung von molekularen Quadraten. Des Weiteren kann, als zusätzliches Beispiel, die Bildung eines Koordinationspolymers angeführt werden. Es bildet sich bei der Reaktion von Titanocen(III) mit 4,4`-Bipyridin. Ebenso wurden verschiedene fluoridverbrückte Titanocen(III)verbindungen isoliert und charakterisiert. Die Oxidation erfolgt hierbei durch die Umsetzung Titanocen(II)acetylenkomplexen mit fluoridhaltigen Ammoniumsalzen. <dt.> Within the scope of this thesis the reactivities of titanocenes in the oxidation state II and III with aromatic N-heterocycles like 4,4`-azobis(pyridine) and 4,4`bipyridine has been examined. Titanocene(II)acetylene complexes and the compound [Cp2Ti(III)(THF)2][B(Ph)4] are used as precursors. In such a way, a set of mono- and dinuclear up to multinuclear complexes has been synthesized and characterized. Especially, the reaction of titanocenes with permethylated and tert.-butylsubstituted cyclopentadienylligands with 4,4`-azobis(pyridine) lead to the formation of molecular squares. Furthermore, the formation of a coordination polymer can be alleged as a suplementary example. This polymer is formed through the reaction of titanocene(III) with 4,4`-bipyridine. Likewise, varoius fluorine bridged titanocene(III) complexes are obtained. Here, the oxidation ensues from the oxidation of titanocene(II)acetylene complexes with fluorine containing ammionium salts. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7652572-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244545-0>
Impact of motif content on dynamic function of complex networks ¤ Network motif; Network analysis; Train transportation; Phase synchronization; Social networks; Motif theory; Null model This pattern of over- and underrepresentation of small subgraphs has become a standard method for characterizing complex networks and evaluating the influence of a mesoscopic organizational level on the function of a network. This work deals with a series of network-based systems with a focus on motifs. Initially, an analytical prediction of motif number and fluctuations is introduced. It is used to predict motif signatures arising from unusual graph properties. We also discuss artifacts that arise from discrepancies between the investigated network and its null model. In a model of social dynamics, we show that successful and unsuccessful agents systematically have different local motif neighborhoods. In co-authorship networks, we find that some are systematically more successful than others. Finally, we deal with the network of train connections. The most important result is a correlation between synchronization and delay propagation. This can be replicated in a simple avalanche model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075298-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9>
Light deflection in the post-linear gravitational field of bounded point-like masses ¤ This work deals with light deflection in the post-linear gravitational field of a system of two bound point masses. It is assumed that both the light source and the observer are located in the infinite in an asymptotically flat space. The equations of light propagation are explicitly integrated up to the order $G2̂/c4̂$. In the work, it is shown that the expression for light deflection calculated in this work agrees with the result of Kopeikin and Schäfer up to their calculated order. The expression for light deflection takes a particularly simple form when the unperturbed light beam propagates perpendicular to the orbital plane of a binary system, whose components have equal mass. The application of the calculated formulas for light deflection to the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 under the assumption of a shock parameter five times greater than the distance between the components of the binary system shows that the corrections to an Epstein-Shapiro light deflection angle of $10{̂-6}$ arcsec lie between $10{̂-7}$ and $10{̂-8}$ arcsec. The corrections caused by the self-rotation impulses of the components of PSR J0737-3039 lie between $10{̂-8}$ and $10{̂-9}$ arcsec.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072014-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167570-8>

State Understanding and Enterprise Development: A Case Study of Chinese Printing Companies ¤ In this work, a method for a cross-cultural comparative study between China and the West was developed. This method allows for enterprise development in China to be understood from its own historical context, rather than just from a purely theoretical perspective. Since current scientific theories are mostly from Western culture and are connected with value judgments and terms from the Western cultural sphere, they must be considered in the historical context of the Western cultural sphere. In the first part of the work, the Western modern state is used as a research concept, its conditions of origin and its use and manner of use, particularly how it influences economic theory and practice in the West, with the modern state principle playing an important role. The New Institutional Economics serves as a theoretical framework for this work. Through a theoretical extension with the Western modern state understanding, important Western constitutional institutions are analyzed, as they influence the rights and obligations of citizens and the formation of the capitalist enterprise. In the second part of the work, the Chinese state understanding is analyzed – from the traditional „Tianxia“ to the „modern“ state. Using derived criteria, Chinese enterprise development is considered in three temporal cross-sectional phases, how Chinese companies develop from traditional to „modern“. As a case study, Chinese printing companies are used. First, the printing system and its changes in three time phases are considered. In this, the aspects of printing organization, state administration, such as censorship and copyright, as well as teaching material are focused on, which are important for the development of printing companies and represent a system. From a micro perspective, three printing companies are analyzed in the time phases. The result of the work is that conclusions are drawn, e.g. that modernization should be understood as actualization, but not as destruction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008598-3>
Theoretical Investigation of Monovacancies in SiC Polytypes ¤ Within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), vacancies in group-IV semiconductors are investigated, where the exchange-correlation interaction of electrons is treated both in local density approximation (LDA) and local spin density approximation (LSDA). Structural effects such as atomic relaxations or symmetry-reducing Jahn-Teller distortions are considered on the basis of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In this case, ionic interactions are described by non-norm-conserving pseudopotentials. As a basis, plane waves are used.

Localisation and tracking of people using distributed UWB sensors ¤ In many surveillance and rescue scenarios, the localization and tracking of people indoors without cooperation is required. For the detection of objects through walls at short to medium distances, the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar technology is promising due to its high temporal resolution and penetration capability. In this work, a process is presented with which people can be localized indoors using UWB sensors. It includes, in addition to the acquisition of measurement data, distance estimates, and the detection of multiple targets, also their location and tracking. Due to the weak reflection of people compared to the rest of the environment, a background subtraction method is used for person recognition first. Then, a constant false alarm rate method is applied for detection and distance estimation of people. For multiple target localization with a UWB sensor, an association method is developed to assign the target distance estimates to the correct targets. In scenarios with multiple targets, it can occur that a target closer to the sensor shades another. A concept for a distributed UWB sensor network is presented, in which the field of view of the system can be expanded by using multiple sensors with different fields of view. A prototype was developed, which enables the tracking of multiple targets in real-time through the fusion of sensor data. Synchronization and cooperation aspects play a particularly important role here. Sensor data can be disturbed by time delay and systematic errors. False measurements and noise in the measurements affect the accuracy of the estimator results. Further insights into the target states can be gained by using temporal information. A multiple target tracking system is developed based on the probability hypothesis density filter, and the differences in system performance are investigated with regard to the information provided by the sensors, i.e., the fusion of location information and the fusion of distance information. The information that a target should be detected when it is not recognized due to shading by other targets in the scenario is described as dynamic coverage probability. The dynamic coverage probability is integrated into the tracking system, which allows fewer sensors to be used while simultaneously improving the performance of the estimator in this scenario. When selecting and developing methods, the requirement for real-time application in unknown scenarios was taken into account. Each aspect of multiple person localization investigated in this work was verified using simulations and measurements in a realistic environment with UWB sensors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311226-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402719-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4582612-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4830023-8>
High-Resolution X-Ray Polarimetry ¤ Within the scope of this work, precision polarimetry in the X-ray range was successfully developed and improved. By optimizing the crystal surface treatment and using multiple reflections at a Bragg angle of θB = 45°, the polarization purity of X-ray polarimeters was increased to δ0 = 2.4.10-10 at an energy of 6.5 keV [49]. The best polarization purity was determined with 6-reflection channel cuts. Increasing the number of reflections to 8 in the channel cut did not lead to further improvement of the polarization purity. Possible limitations for the best polarization purity achieved so far were determined to be, on the one hand, multiple scattering and, on the other hand, source divergence. The limitation due to source divergence could be overcome in the future by improvements in X-ray sources (XFEL, ESRF upgrade, Petra III upgrade) as well as by X-ray optics that improve beam divergence. The second limitation of polarization purity, the influence of multiple scattering, is determined by the rocking curve tails. It was found that the rocking curve tails do not correspond to the theoretical course of the dynamic theory. This well-known "Wing problem" was attempted to be solved by using industrially polished quasi-channel cut crystals. A quasi-channel cut polarimeter was developed and successfully tested for the use of silicon wafers. Investigations showed that no change in the rocking curve tails can be achieved by this means. The above-mentioned best value of polarization purity could be confirmed within the measurement error.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184234-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294605-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178318-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174982-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207744-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4287503-1>
Constitutional and EU Law Frameworks for Charging Self-Generation with the EEG Levy ¤ With the EEG levy, the costs of renewable energy expansion were passed on to electricity consumers until 2023. Originally, the levy obligation was tied to electricity supply, so that self-generated electricity was not taken into account. The so-called self-consumption privilege was essentially abolished with the EEG 2014. However, various exceptions led to the fact that a large part of self-consumption quantities remained privileged. The work examines to what extent this patchwork of different regulations is due to the constitutional and EU law frameworks. In addition to a systematic collection of the statutory legal framework, an analysis is carried out to the extent to which constitutional and EU law restricts the legislative scope for state-initiated, but privately designed levy systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133665-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151199-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130688-0>

In the center stands the architect and city building councillor Willy Hahn, who was elected as the first full-time >Technical City Councillor< of the city of Kiel in 1921 and determined the urban development and artistic design of this city for nine years. After the lost First World War, the city of Kiel, which had been oriented solely on armaments production up to then, faced the heavy task of developing an economic reconstruction program on a civilian foundation, which also required new urban development perspectives	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144201-5>
D̲sr-s.t - Studies on the Small Temple of Medinet Habu ¤ The subject of the study is a small sanctuary on the west bank of Thebes, erected in the 18th dynasty by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III at the southern end of the Theban necropolis in the cult area of Medinet Habu: The so-called Small Temple of Medinet Habu bore, according to Egyptian sources, the name D̲sr-s.t and was dedicated to the ancient Egyptian god Amun-Re. The temple, largely preserved to this day, is the longest-used cult site in Medinet Habu. It is the oldest cult building for Amun-Re at this location and was significantly expanded by numerous additions from the time of its construction to the Roman imperial period. Medinet Habu and its cult buildings were investigated by the German architect and Egyptologist Uvo Hölscher for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in the first three decades of the last century. Following the archaeological fieldwork, a detailed evaluation of the excavation findings emerged, which was published in several volumes in the Oriental Institute Publications of the University of Chicago. Despite the excellently published findings, the Small Temple has never been the subject of a single study since Uvo Hölscher ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059416-6>
Pharmacokinetics of Betamethasone and Triamcinolone Acetonide after intraarticular Application regarding doping relevance in horses ¤ Betamethasone, Triamcinolone Acetonide, Pharmacokinetics. - The objectives of the present work were the optimization and validation of an HPLC/MS/MS method for the quantitative analysis of betamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide from horse urine and plasma, as well as the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters by conducting studies on the pharmacokinetics after intraarticular administration of various corticosteroids in horses. On the current state of doping analysis, it should be checked whether detection times for the intraarticular application of glucocorticoids can be predicted. The presented analytical method consists of a wet-chemical sample preparation and subsequent analysis by HPLC/MS/MS. The validation was carried out in accordance with the parameters selectivity, linearity, detection limit, quantification limit, precision, accuracy, stability, and recovery. It was shown that the method meets all the set criteria and is therefore suitable. The detection limits are 0.004 ng/ml for betamethasone in urine and plasma. Triamcinolone acetonide can be detected with certainty up to a concentration of 0.008 ng/ml in plasma and 0.010 ng/ml in urine. In test series, betamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide were applied to horses and blood and urine samples were then taken, which were examined for the applied substance.

Change of Refractive Index by Ion Exchange in Structured Glass Components ¤ The material scientific fundamentals for the change of refractive index by ion exchange in a glass (FS21) structured according to a special process (photostructuring) have been created. The reduction of refractive index was favored and investigated in detail. By the subsequent processing of the glass with the technologies photostructuring and change of refractive index by ion exchange, the production of delicate light-conducting glass components is possible. From this, applications in microsystem or precision engineering can be explored. Possible are, for example, grippers and springs with integrated sensor function based on light conduction and the utilization of light conduction for special measurement tasks. - For the ion exchange, a salt melt with a composition of 100 % NaNO3 is used. A cost-effective experimental setup was developed and the process parameters were designed so that the ion exchange can be performed reproducibly and yet can be controlled by changing the ion exchange temperature and duration. - The work deals extensively with the diffusion profiles created by ion exchange in glass FS21 and their dependence on the ion exchange parameters. Theoretically expected relationships between diffusion coefficients and profile depths and ion exchange temperature and duration were found experimentally. In addition, special features in connection with the three ions Li+, Na+ and K+ present in the glass are addressed. - Mechanical compressive stresses due to ion exchange are demonstrated in specially designed ion exchange experiments and are described in more detail by measuring the difference in travel. - The expected change of refractive index is calculated in advance from the diffusion profiles (profiles of chemical composition). The comparison with measured refractive index profiles allows the interpretation of the mechanism of refractive index reduction. Similarly, the formation of refractive index profiles in dependence on ion exchange temperature and duration is also investigated. These results agree with those of the diffusion profiles. - Simple light-guiding elements were produced and in them the parameters light-guiding component cross-section, ion exchange temperature and duration were varied. The light intensity at the exit of these light-guiding elements is characterized with respect to the mentioned parameters and maxima are found. In U-shaped and light-guiding elements, the light-guiding function was demonstrated in principle experiments and thus hints at the possibilities of the geometric diversity of light-guiding components. The work can be a starting point for both application research and glass fundamentals research and contains corresponding proposals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159653-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021142-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267405-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146524-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162300-9>
Investigations on Properties and Development of Formaldehyde-Free Chemical Copper Baths ¤ Chemical copper electrolytes without external current have a great importance in the metallization process in the printed circuit board industry. Almost exclusively formaldehyde-containing electrolytes are used. Despite the well-known environmental and health hazards of formaldehyde, these baths are successful, not least due to the good cost efficiency, the quality of the copper layers, and the simple and reliable handling. However, the increasingly stringent environmental guidelines require new perspectives in the field of chemical copper deposition. Many alternative reducing agents have already been described and investigated for the replacement of formaldehyde. Nevertheless, there is currently no formaldehyde-free chemical copper bath that is successfully used commercially. The reasons for this are mainly the narrow working ranges of the copper electrolytes, the inadequate coverage of the base materials, the incomplete reduction of the copper ions from the complex, and the deposition of very thin copper layers, as no autocatalytic deposition process is present. In addition, disturbing by-products and instabilities in the electrolyte can occur. Some of the alternatives to formaldehyde are also environmentally and health hazardous and are also very cost-intensive. In this work, environmentally friendly reducing agents are presented and checked with regard to their ability to perform autocatalytic copper deposition. A combination and variation of selected complex-forming agents with the respective reducing agents are carried out to investigate their suitability in the process of formaldehyde-free chemical copper deposition. Based on this, individual formaldehyde-free copper baths are developed. Through chemical and electrochemical investigations of both the bath components and during the deposition process, the formaldehyde-free copper electrolytes can be characterized and analyzed. Their mode of action and the properties of the copper layers are compared with formaldehyde-containing copper baths. The reducing agent glyoxylic acid is a suitable alternative for the formaldehyde-free autocatalytic copper deposition process due to its similar chemical properties to formaldehyde. Glyoxylic acid is not only usable with the existing activation methods, but also with many variable electrolyte components. The preferred complex-forming agents are HEDTA and Sorbit. Special electrolyte additives, in particular sodium hypophosphite, which supports the initial phase of copper deposition, enable the optimization of the glyoxylic acid-containing copper electrolytes with regard to the requirements to be achieved (e.g. high deposition rate).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177311-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246754-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223142-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4602514-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169599-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279388-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203342-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143687-8>

Calcium-regulated transcription in plant innate immunity : interplay between CAMTA3 and MAPKs and CDPKs ¤ CAMTA3 was shown to be rapidly phosphorylated after PAMP treatment. It interacts with the PAMP-responsive MAPKs, MPK3 and MPK6, in vivo. Mass spectrometry, following in vitro phosphorylation assays, identified multiple phospho-sites in CAMTA3 that are directly phosphorylated by MAPKs. In vivo, MAPK-mediated phosphorylation results in subcellular re-localization and proteasome-mediated degradation of CAMTA3. In parallel, the PAMP-activated CPK5, also interacts with CAMTA3 in vivo and also causes CAMTA3 phosphorylation at sites distinct from those targeted by MAPKs. However, in vitro phosphorylation assays did not support a direct phosphorylation of CAMTA3 by CPK5. The proposed working model is that at least two major PAMP-activated kinase pathways (i.e. MAPKs and CDPKs) converge on CAMTA3, where phosphorylation induces CAMTA3 subcellular re-localization and degradation. CAMTA3 is released from defense-related gene promoters and expression of downstream defense genes is de-repressed. This supports the negative role of CAMTA3 in plant innate immune pathways and a phosphorylation-dependent control of its function.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174459-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185906-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147215-9>
The Significance of Estates in Libraries - Illustrated by the Estate of Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann-Michel in the Library of the Sprengel Museum Hannover ¤ Written estates are collected and managed in German libraries in a long tradition. In the present bachelor's thesis, the peculiarity of written estates and the development of estate processing are explained. Initially, definitions of terms, significance, and developments in estate processing are presented to introduce the topic. The question of responsibility for taking over an estate and the related competence dispute is linked to the introductions. Subsequently, acquisition is addressed. The various acquisition methods are presented, and the possible legal problems in acquisition are shown. Estate processing is presented in terms of cancellation, ordering, indexing, and measures for preserving the collection. The topic of written estates is completed with aspects and questions of use. The theoretical treatise is followed by the documentation of the ordering and indexing of the photograph collection from the estate of Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann-Michel, which begins with the presentation of the artist couple and their estate.

The documentation is completed with recommendations for the future processing of the photographs and the entire estate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Finite element simulation for the cold-joining of high power connectors ¤ In the context of this work, a new method for describing massive copper cold-press contacts is developed. The calculation of press connections according to DIN 7190 is not applicable for the design of massive copper contacts, as high deformation rates and friction stresses occur during the joining process. The new model not only provides shortened and efficient design cycles for new high-performance contacts (HPC), but also deepens the understanding of the joining process and contact properties. After a brief motivation of the topic and an introduction to cold contact technology, the fundamentals of experimental work and simulation methods are worked out in Chapter 3. The challenges in modeling joining processes lie in material description and friction characterization. Therefore, the two topics are presented in two independent chapters, starting from the current state of the art to the validation of the developed methods and models. Chapter 4 deals with material description and includes two new methods for determining the flow properties of copper materials on a component level. The friction behavior in a pressing process is investigated in Chapter 5. A new test stand was set up to determine friction coefficients and describe the occurring wear mechanisms. Material description and friction characterization are closely linked. Therefore, both models were integrated into a finite element (FE) tool to be able to describe the complex interactions. Guidelines are developed and proposed for a precise but with as little effort as possible connected FE description of pressing processes. Based on the FE model, new high-current contacts are developed. The model was successfully validated and its validity impressively demonstrated by comparing the simulated and real properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033734-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049098-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154640-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351613-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165128-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151733-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4581378-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1077381565> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192147-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8>
Online Communication of Members of the German Bundestag: Politicians in the New Land ¤ With a complex statistical analysis strategy, Christoph Blank succeeds in explaining the selective political online communication behavior of members of the German Bundestag validly. At the same time, he expands the common member typologies from member sociology with his result. His research instrumentarium and his differentiated findings from a written survey of 208 MPs in 2009 offer themselves as a basis for special follow-up studies. "Self-marketing" is the primary motive of members of the German Bundestag when using digital political communication possibilities. One-way communication predominantly determines their network activities. Interaction and participation offers are offered to citizens rather rarely.

Band-Displaced Heterostructures for the Utilization of Hot Charge Carriers in Third-Generation Solar Cells ¤ The present work presents results of the experimental examination of the original concept for a hot charge carrier solar cell. The developed solar cell is intended to demonstrate an energy gain through photogenerated hot charge carriers and thus to show a new approach for the further development of more efficient solar cells. Two prototype structures based on Au:Zn/InP/PbSe/ZnO:Al and Ag/ZnTe/PbSe/ZnO:Al were manufactured using cost-effective technology processes. The band displacements and crystal structure in a novel heteroepitaxial ZnTe/PbSe structure were determined and published. The entire band arrangement of the two prototype cells was reconstructed and analyzed. Both prototype cells were characterized using both classical and a novel double-beam measurement method. In the second double heterostructure, a higher yield of hot charge carriers was found and justified. At the second prototype, under natural sunlight and at room temperature, a zero-voltage greater than the bandgap of the absorber was determined. This characteristic behavior for hot charge carrier solar cells was confirmed by further independent measurements. The unusual curves for the second solar cell prototype required a new interpretation of the dynamics of hot charge carriers based on kinetic transport theory and thermoelectricity theory. Both models were considered in terms of the previously known phenomena and presented in the present work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014241-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181740-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4260178-2>
Social Acceleration in Non-Western Societies: The Case Study of Iran ¤ This dissertation addresses the question of the establishment and development of modern social institutions in so-called non-Western societies. The Iranian society serves as the case study to paradigmatically represent the social, economic, and cultural conditions in a non-Western society. The work relies primarily on a historically-sociological perspective on Iran for empirical support. The theory of social acceleration serves as the theoretical foundation, and it is argued that the various types of functional mechanisms and potential connections of the motors of social acceleration lead to different accelerated social formations or social constellations. A detailed examination of the modes and motors of social acceleration, their functioning, and mutual connections forms the basis for understanding the problem of establishing an accelerating social formation in Iranian society. It is shown that, throughout the 20th century, the three motors of social acceleration in Iranian society consistently struggled with three corresponding problems: 'autocratic modernization measures (the economic motor)', 'uncompleted social differentiation (the structural motor)', and 'the promise of a closed utopian future (the cultural motor)'.

Optimization of Complex Movement Patterns in Throwing Movements ¤ The maximization of the takeoff speed of the competition equipment and the target precision are of decisive importance for the success in the competition in sports games as well as in the athletic throwing disciplines. Although the training methods have been optimized in recent years, it remains the privilege of a few athletes to set the absolute top in this area. These differences in the quality of movement execution are largely individually determined on the basis of an individually optimally developed movement coordination. Since the classical, program-oriented technical training does not represent the desired solution path, an attempt was made in this volume to develop a system-dynamically oriented, differential training program, which, applied in a meaningful time frame, should bring about an improvement in movement coordination. By means of a processor-oriented research approach, the kinematic and electromyographic features were recorded within a one-year training study, where the system-dynamically oriented method proved to be more effective in contrast to the program-oriented training method	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4289011-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145145-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127337-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139985-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128991-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023214-1>

Hervey Bay - insights from numerical modelling into the hydrodynamics of an Australian subtropical bay ¤ Hervey Bay, a large coastal embayment situated off the central eastern coast of Australia, is a shallow tidal area, close to the continental shelf, that shows features of an inverse estuary, due to the high evaporation (approx. 2 m/year) and low precipitation (less than 1 m/year). Due to the high tidal range (> 3.5 m) the bay is considered as a vertically well-mixed system. Recent field measurements, but also the numerical simulations indicate a nearly persistent mean salinity gradient of 0.5 psu across the bay, with low salinities (35.5 psu) in the open ocean and peak values (> 39.0 psu) in the head water of the bay. The investigation further shows that wind forcing is the main driver for exchange processes within the bay. Due to a long-lasting drying trend along the east coast of Australia and a significant change in local climate, the frequency of hypersaline and inverse conditions has increased. Moreover, the salinity flux out of the bay has increased and the evaporation induced residual circulation has accelerated. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274370-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130725-2>

Investigations on Laser Beam Welding with Dynamic Polarization ¤ In the present work, the influence of a fast, spatially and temporally defined change (up to the kHz range) of the polarization state of CO2 laser radiation (Dynamic Polarization DP) on the dynamic processes in the interaction volume during CO2 laser beam welding is investigated. The implementation of this method is based on a special arrangement consisting of an interference laser radiation modulator (ILM-H) and a ? 2 -unit, which enables the generation of a beam with constant total power but temporally variable polarization state. By means of exemplary welding experiments on the materials Ck45, St37 and 22MnB5 (USIBOR) as well as on St37 under application of contrast materials with continuous powers up to about 3 kW, the expected DP effects were experimentally investigated and qualitatively explained by means of model-based assumptions and estimates. The arrangement of the ILM-H in double transmission used in this case is the basic prerequisite for DP, which is not realizable by means of other modulator types (e.g. electro- and acoustooptic modulators). The ILM-H is based on previous ILM models and was further developed in the framework of this work for powers in the multi-kW range. The characterization of the experimental behavior of the ILM-H shows that the beam splitting function for continuous (cw) powers up to 2 kW follows almost the theory of the ideal Fabry-Pérot interferometer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4624080-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074024-9>
Investigations on the Variability of Diatom Associations in Waters of Different Trophic Layers, as well as their Impact on Practiced Indication Utilization ¤ The focus of this work was the capture of the variability of diatom species compositions in the presediment of northern German lakes and their impact on the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental variables based on transfer functions. A distinction was made between spatial variability within and between lakes and temporal variability within a lake (seasonal and annual). Based on the results, new models could be developed, which led to a significant improvement in the prediction error of transfer functions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006841-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030509-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304982-5>
Ruling through Prevention : A Critical Analysis of Burnout Prevention after Michel Foucault ¤ In view of the global crisis of mental health, it is essential to consider burnout prevention as a government problem and part of a prevention dispositif. From the perspective of governmentality, Jozef Zelinka shows how the prevention of mental disorders is used to secure the neoliberal performance society: subjects are pushed towards self-management by continuous risk pressure and risk calculation. The critical dispositif analysis makes these discursive, everyday practical, and above all material manifestations of prevention visible	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1079427864> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002643-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195380-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125750-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171438-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7632874-0>
Nonlinear dynamics in complex networks and modeling human dynamics ¤ Through large data sets, researchers can investigate the properties of complex systems, e.g. complex networks and human behavior dynamics. A large number of systems are represented as large and complex networks, e.g. the Internet, power grids, economic systems. More and more researchers have a great interest in the dynamics of complex networks. This work consists of the following three parts. The first part is a simple dynamic optimization coupling mechanism, but very effective. Through the mechanism, synchronization in complex networks with and without time delay can be realized, and the ability of synchronization of small-world and scale-free networks can be improved. In the second part, the enhancement of the robustness of scale-free networks in relation to the community structure is discussed. Some reaction patterns and topological communities are uniform. The results show a new aspect of the relationship between functions and network topology of complex networks. In the third part, which plays an important role in complex networks, the behavior dynamics of human communication is investigated through data and model analysis, and a new communication model is developed. With the help of an interaction priority-queue model, the new model can be explained. With the help of the model, many practical interaction systems can be explained, e.g. email and letters (or post). With my investigation, human behavior can be learned anew on the individual and network level. In the fourth part, I can prove that human comment behavior in online social systems, a different type of interaction dynamics of humans is non-Poisson and can be explained by the model. With the help of non-Poisson processes, the personal attraction model can be better understood. The results are helpful for learning the pattern of human behavior in online societies and the development of public opinion not only in virtual societies but also in real societies. At the end, it is about a prognosis of human dynamics and complex networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114261-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126141-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9>
Series Investigation of Meat Ripening and Microbiological Status of Wild Boar Meat and Deer Meat ¤ Wild meat, Cooling, Microbiological Quality. - The quality of wild meat is largely determined by the circumstances during the shooting and care, as well as further by the handling during the entire ripening and storage period up to processing. The current EU food law stipulates that wild bodies of shot game must be cooled to not more than +7 ʿC within a reasonable period of time after shooting. In addition, meat from free-living game may only be brought into circulation if the wild body has been transported to a wild processing plant as soon as possible. In contrast to the previously existing law with precise time specifications, shot game could be stored in the deck at +7 ʿC for up to 9 days and at +1 ʿC for up to 17 days and transported to a wild processing plant, the current legislation lacks a definition of the requirement to be transported as soon as possible, thereby making interpretation more difficult. The present investigation should contribute to the elimination of uncertainties in connection with the interpretation of the new regulations by checking the development of the microflora under consideration of various cooling regimes. For the quality of wild meat, in addition to the microbiological status of freshly shot wild animals, the subsequent ripening processes are of great importance. Both aspects are determined by the post-mortem storage conditions. A good wild cooling should ensure high microbiological safety as well as the formation of...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354980-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177558-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316357-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132435-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189884-9>
Biofuel Policy in Germany: On the Discursive Construction of a Multiple Problem Solution ¤ Biofuels in Germany -- Interpretative Policy Analysis -- Discourse Coalitions -- Environmental, Agricultural, and Energy Policy -- Ecological Modernization -- Neoliberalization Biofuels have been promoted as a potential solution for a wide range of problems since the 1980s: from oil dependence to agricultural structural change and climate change. Against the backdrop of the German biofuel policy's sudden and sometimes contradictory course, Thomas Vogelpohl draws the societal construction of biofuels over the past thirty years and their reflection in political decisions discursively. He examines how biofuels have gained and maintained their status as a political solution option in Germany and how this complex social construction process can be understood in the context of historically specific political-institutional and paradigmatic framework conditions.

Occurrence and Avoidance of Pathogenic Clostridia in Biogas Plant Substrates and Residues ¤ In the context of a plant screening, inputs and residues of various biogas plants were tested for the presence of pathogenic Clostridia. Independently of the operation mode and temperature, pathogenic Clostridia could be identified in input and residue samples. The sensitivity of spores of pathogenic Clostridia to high temperatures, depending on various residence times, was also tested in hygiene experiments. Spores of C. sporogenes and C. perfringens survive the standard hygiene temperature of 70 °C for at least ten hours.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7658700-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148085-5>
Process Evaluation in Logistics: Key Performance Indicator-Based Analysis Methodology for Enhancing Logistics Competence ¤ The knowledge of weaknesses in the company's own logistics is the first step to unlocking new performance potential. In order to use specific logistics knowledge to initiate targeted process improvements, however, structured analyses are necessary that allow for a detailed evaluation of one's own logistics processes in the performance dimensions of time, quality, and cost on various process levels. Christian Büssow develops a multi-stage analysis methodology for continuous evaluation of the company's own logistics systems based on performance indicators. It is supported by partial results and individual instruments such as a logistics reference model with an extensive catalog of around 350 key performance indicators and allows adaptation to one's own framework conditions and objectives. The author presents a prototype of an internet-based application that captures key performance indicators, analyzes logistics processes, and assigns specific content to a knowledge platform for targeted process improvement of identified weaknesses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124261-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036210-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199312-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2>

Heterochromatic Gene Silencing and the Control of Pathogenicity of C. graminicola ¤ Colletotrichum graminicola; Pathogenität; Epigenetik; Heterochromatin; Histone methylation; DNA methylation; Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) The filamentous ascomycete Colletotrichum graminicola is the causative agent of anthracnose leaf spot and stalk rot on corn. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for the formation of heterochromatin, such as H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or DNA methylation, have been poorly understood in this organism. Targeted knockout analyzes of putative histone and DNA methyltransferase genes reveal that these factors play a crucial role in the formation of heterochromatin in C. graminicola. The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) acts as an adapter between H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. Furthermore, it has been shown that this heterochromatin protein 1 is essential for the pathogenicity of the fungus.

On the Principle of Business Continuation in Insolvency ¤ Insolvency and Continuation -- Insolvency Law and Insolvency Accounting -- The Continuation Assumption in Insolvency Accounting -- A Heuristic Solution to the Timing Problem -- The Summary of the Results. The evaluation of the principle of business continuation is considered one of the most difficult problem statements in accounting. As a fundamental principle, it has direct consequences for accounting in terms of basis, amount, and presentation. The determination of the point in time from which no longer bilaterally from the continuation principle can be departed is therefore of decisive importance. In addition, it must be examined when a revival of the continuation principle is required. Based on a normative research approach, Stefan Eickes penetrates this problem statement for the case of the insolvent company and shows which problems in particular need to be taken into account in determining the point in time.

Complex structures, disorder and low dimensionality - treatment of oxides and semiconductors by a relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method ¤ The thesis describes the implementation of the fully-relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method within the full-potential approximation. In contrast to previous implementations the single-site scattering problem is obtained by a direct solution of a system of ordinary differential equations. The choice of this approach is motivated from an extensive numerical investigation of the problem. Furthermore, the relativistic KKR method is used to investigate the tuning of band inversion in Pb_xSn_(1-x)Te alloys. Additionally, a scalar relativistic approximation was applied to study the low temperature magnetostructure of PrMnO3 and CaMnO3. With the help of the Mathematica group theory package GTPack single Ho atoms on a Pt(111) surface are investigated within the framework of crystal field theory.

Application of Adaptive Learning Procedures for the Regulation of Industrial Combustion Processes ¤ In this work, it is shown how adaptive learning process models can contribute to improving process management in large industrial combustion plants. To this end, the essential components of such a combustion process are presented, and it is explained why conventional control procedures (e.g. PID controllers) cannot or only inadequately control parts of this process. Learning models are essentially capable of ensuring better process management. It is also shown which problems standard learning procedures have with real process data. In the main part of the work, three improvement approaches are developed: The influence of noisy data on the learning process. In order to obtain good models despite such data, both noisy points (outliers) are removed from the data set and robust training procedures are used. The adaptation of a learning model to changes in the process over long periods of time. It is shown that adapting the model leads to advantages over a static model. On combustion data, the best results are achieved with the weighted combination of adaptive models in ensembles. The functional safety of the control strategy of a learning model. Learning standard procedures often fail due to the distribution of data in already regulated processes. To avoid such errors, several complementary approaches are developed. Significant is the integration of expert knowledge into the learning process. By comparing with existing data of the plant, knowledge can be specifically integrated for unknown areas and the reliability of learning controllers can be increased. The essential feature of this work compared to other works on learning process models lies in the immediate practical reference to combustion processes. The presented procedures were tested on various waste incineration plants and cement works over several weeks and months. Solutions are shown that enable learning systems to actively control control variables over long periods of time and thus achieve a significant improvement in process management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279983-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000105-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026818-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4775650-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222919-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062656-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000457-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197295-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4720440-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120666-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308299-3>

Conversion of Ethanol to Butanol on Heterogeneous Catalysts ¤ With an annual production of more than 3.6 million tons, n-Butanol (Butanol) is one of the most important commodities worldwide. It is produced on a large scale from propylene using the Oxo-Synthesis. In contrast, ethanol has a production volume of 85 million t/a, produced in the largest fermentation process in the world, cost-effective and available in large quantities. Due to dwindling fossil resources and the additional scarcity of propylene due to shale gas fracking, alternative production methods for butanol are becoming increasingly important. One of these methods is the Guerbet reaction, in which ethanol is condensed to butanol on heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, heterogeneous catalysts were developed for the discontinuous and continuous reaction guidance of the Guerbet reaction from ethanol to butanol. For this, hydroxyapatite (HAP), hydrotalcite (HT), magnesium oxide (MgO), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) were intensively studied in the first place, following the results of screening experiments, under previously established standard conditions. HT (SBuOH=55-68%) and self-made MgO (SBuOH = 72%) achieved promising results. Subsequently, the carrier materials HAP, HT-Mg70, MgO-425°C, and Al2O3 were used to produce metal carrier catalysts, which were then comprehensively tested. The results of the experiments showed that higher yields and butanol selectivities can be achieved with small amounts of a metal compared to the pure carrier materials. Furthermore, the long-term stability of 1% Co/Al2O3 and 10% Ni/Al2O3 in repeated batches and in the Konti reactor was examined, which showed very good results with constant yields and selectivities in the Konti reactor for both catalysts. Consequently, an optimization was carried out with the catalyst systems, which particularly showed the large impact of catalyst reduction on the results of the reaction. Subsequently, the influence of various reaction parameters in the batch and Konti reactors on the reaction was studied to increase the yield and butanol selectivity. In addition, experiments on the mechanism and reaction network of the Guerbet reaction were also carried out, for which various intermediates, by-products, and butanol as educts were used in the batch reactor. The results of the experiments pointed to a multi-stage mechanism of the reaction from ethanol to butanol.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342781-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123377-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144119-9>
In-situ Measurement and Simulation of Liquid Phase Silicification ¤ Liquid phase infiltration of porous carbon preforms with silicon, commonly referred to as Liquid Silicon Infiltration (LSI), is one of the most economical technologies for the production of carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC). Despite decades of research, the physical phenomena at the infiltration front are not yet sufficiently understood. Consequently, no mechanistic model exists that would help optimize the production process of C/SiC components. The present work aims to close the research gaps and provide a validated simulation model for process optimization. The work is divided into three parts, where the first part initially deals with the production methods of C/SiC components. Subsequently, the fundamental chemical and physical processes of the reaction of silicon and carbon to silicon carbide are explained. Following the current understanding of the infiltration of porous, carbon fiber reinforced carbon preforms (C/C preforms) with liquid silicon, the state of the art is dealt with the existing infiltration and diffusion models. The second part deals with a newly developed experimental setup for investigating the LSI process. This allows for in-situ observation during the infiltration of a glass carbon slit capillary with silicon. Originally, the experimental setup was intended to validate the recognized infiltration models based on the general capillary theory. However, the experiments showed that the infiltration kinetics fundamentally differs from the behavior predicted by the known infiltration models. Further investigations led to new findings that enabled the development of a mesoscopic model for predicting the actual infiltration behavior. With the infiltration and investigation of porous C/C materials, the application range of the infiltration model is extended to commercial C/C materials. The third and final part deals with the development of a numerical model for simulating the LSI process. For the first time, the reactive infiltration of porous C/C preforms was simulated in three dimensions and the model was validated with in-situ measurements. A newly developed infiltration equation and the introduction of a time-dependent diffusion coefficient led to a good agreement between simulation and measurement results as well as short calculation times even for complex components in industrial scale.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4448314-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4691524-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046811-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4582632-8>
Photooxidation of Water on WO3(001) : a Combined Approach of Periodic Slab Calculations, Embedded Cluster Model, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum Dynamics ¤ In this dissertation the photooxidation of water to WO3(001) was investigated. First the water splitting cycle was analysed with periodic slab models. From the resulting geometries a W12O36 cluster model could be evaluated, with which a three-dimensional potential surface could be calculated using the CASSCF method in the ground state and charge transfer state. These surfaces were then interpolated with a neural network optimised by a genetic algorithm. Finally, the photochemistry could be analysed in wave packet studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148107-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190231-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174537-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127186-5>
Rapidly Crystallizing Glass Rods for Laser Welding Applications ¤ In the field of sensorics, housings made of corundum or sapphire are used because they can withstand high mechanical stresses and can be used in extreme environments. To join these components, sealing materials are necessary that have a linear thermal expansion coefficient adapted to corundum or sapphire (a = 8.4×10-6 K-1) and can be used at temperatures up to 1100 °C. For this purpose, glass rods that crystallize during the joining process are suitable. The temperatures required by conventional joining methods, however, are not suitable for encapsulating temperature-sensitive components, as a short-term, local energy input into the joining zone is required. During a laser joining process, only the joining zone is heated for a short time, and the components are not destroyed. Available crystallizing glass rods still have a high proportion of glass phase after the laser joining process and thus do not achieve the desired operating temperatures of 1100 °C. Therefore, rapidly crystallizing glass rods are considered in this work, which meet the requirements of laser joining. For this purpose, glasses from the systems BaO-TiO2-SiO2 (Glass system A), CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (Glass system B), and MgO-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (Glass system C) were selected, where the SiO2 concentration in systems B and C was kept low (≤ 20 mol%). To determine a suitable temperature-time profile for the laser joining process, the sintering and crystallization behavior was investigated using dynamic differential calorimetry (DSC) and heating microscopy (HSM). Subsequent to this, wetting and joining experiments were carried out using laser beams on various corundum and sapphire capillary tubes. It was shown that glass system A is not suitable for laser joining, as the crystallization rate of the stoichiometric composition is too high and a complete densification of the glass rod is not possible. By increasing the SiO2 content, the sintering behavior of the glass could be significantly improved. However, this increase leads to a decrease in the thermal expansion coefficient, resulting in a strong difference in the linear thermal expansion coefficients of the base material and the glass rod, leading to stress in the joining bond.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4301031-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4691530-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126056-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033215-9>
Nitrogen household during composting balances, contents, turnover-, and release processes ¤ Some N-compounds have a huge resource potential especially if used in agri- and horticulture culture for fertilization. On the other, N-compounds may also lead to strong negative environmental impacts. In the present book, the N-compounds as well as their behavior and changes during composting are described. On the basis of technical scale investigations N-turn-overs and -releases were determined and N-balances generated. Based on this, universally valid principles and models were formulated considering the depend-ency on influencing factors such as substrate composition, degradation stage, water content, pH-value, tem-perature, and gas composition. The occurring processes - ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, immobilisation - are described and discussed. The results allow the evaluation of composting in the context of the global N-household. They also can be used for the development of innovative processes, e.g. for fertilizer production from biowaste and for N-emissions minimisation strategies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183268-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164919-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
The Reliability of Notes to the Financial Statements in IFRS: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis ¤ Appendix from theoretical, normative, and empirical perspectives -- Significance of the audit for the reliability of accounting information -- Importance of the appendix in the annual audit -- Reliability of notes to the financial statements -- Reliability in dependence on the disclosure location. Stefan R. Grabs shows that the reliability is particularly limited by subjective notes to the financial statements in the IFRS financial statements and that the audit in this case can only contribute to an increase to a limited extent. The author first considers the theoretical, normative, and empirical perspectives of the appendix and the audit with a focus on the concept of sufficient audit assurance. Within the framework of his own empirical study, the determinants of the maximum audit assurance of notes to the financial statements are shown, and the effect of the disclosure location (appendix or balance sheet/consolidated income statement) is also analyzed.

Chemically Motivated Hubbard Models: Exact Diagonalization, Charge Transfer, and Local Approximation Methods ¤ Abstract: In this work, chemically specific Hubbard models are investigated. These models originate from the field of theoretical solid-state physics, where they serve to describe the electronic structure of strongly correlated solids. The model parameters required for this purpose are obtained directly from ab-initio calculations. For the solution of the electronic structure problem, the exact diagonalization method has been implemented and parallelized. Specifically, an electron-phonon coupling is introduced, symmetries are utilized, and approximation methods are developed. The approximations combine a local description of d-orbitals with a molecular orbital approach for s- and p-orbitals, delivering correlation energies with an error of a few per mille compared to the exact solution at significantly reduced computational time. With these methods, three problems have been investigated. Firstly, the effect of strong electron correlation on charge transfer in the Creutz-Taube cation and related systems is analyzed. For the iron porphyrin, a separate symmetry consideration was carried out, making the system calculable only with exact diagonalization. For one- and multi-cationic iron-sulfur clusters, the formation of local magnetic moments and the singlet-triplet splitting is investigated. In almost all cases, even strong approximations prove superior to a standard method (unrestricted Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction with single excitations).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382353-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705970-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307016-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013802-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160713-2>
Direct Synthesis of Doped Silicon-Germanium Alloy Crystals using Spark Plasma Sintering, Nutrient Synthesis, and Single Crystal Growth by Zone Melting ¤ Abstract: The central aspect of this work is the synthesis of doped, polycrystalline Silicon-Germanium alloy crystals (SiGe) using the Spark Plasma Sintering method, to make these available through a fast synthesis process for thermoelectrics. Highly doped SiGe alloy crystals can be used as high-temperature thermoelectrics that generate electrical current from a temperature difference using the Seebeck effect. Polycrystalline powders and samples for application were produced through melting processes with subsequent grinding or through mechanical alloying, where hot pressing was used for compaction. These processes are time-consuming and labor-intensive, whereas Spark Plasma Sintering as a current- and pressure-activated sintering process can have significant advantages on sintering temperature and duration as well as material properties due to the effects of the current. In the framework of this doctoral thesis, doped, polycrystalline Silicon-Germanium samples with 96 at% Si and 4 at% Ge as a cost-effective variant, as well as the composition with 80 at% Si and 20 at% Ge as the most efficient thermoelectric composition were synthesized. Classical elements such as B and P, as well as GaP and a combination of GaP and P were used as dopants. The synthesis of p-type Si0.96Ge0.04 alloy crystals proceeded largely successfully with the used temperature programs, so that comparable ZT values at room temperature could be obtained compared to samples from the literature, produced by arc synthesis. For the n-type material, the doping proved to be more difficult, so that for further syntheses a doping with SiP was pursued. In this way, for the Si0.80Ge0.20 material, carrier concentrations comparable to those of strongly phosphorus-doped samples from the literature could be generated through the small addition of SiP. For the p-type Si0.80Ge0.20 material, further optimization of homogeneity was carried out by determining the optimal synthesis temperature through calibration of the oven. This was necessary, as the temperature set on the SPS oven differs from the temperature in the sintering crucible. Building on the SPS synthesis, the crystallographic part consisted of nutrient synthesis for single crystal growth. This was carried out through direct syntheses un ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/107936899X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311718-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140616-3>
Multivariate hydrometeorological extreme events and their impacts on vegetation : potential methods and applications ¤ Droughts and heatwaves affect our society and vegetation. Especially in the context of climate change, the impacts on vegetation are of particular importance. In the global carbon cycle, terrestrial ecosystems are normally carbon sinks, but can become carbon sources during and after climate extreme events. A crucial aspect here is the role of different plant species and vegetation types at various scales, which influence the impacts on the carbon cycle. Although physiological differences between different plant species suggest different reactions to extreme events, these differences have not been systematically evaluated and fully understood at the global level. Another aspect is that climate extreme events are naturally multivariate. For example, hot air can absorb more water than cold air. Extreme events with significant impacts have been frequent in the past, such as in Europe in 2003, Russia in 2012, or the USA in 2012. This multivariate nature of climate extremes requires a multivariate perspective on these events. So far, single variables are mostly used for the detection of extreme events and no covariation or non-linearity is considered. New generic workflows that consider such multivariate structures must be developed or transferred from other disciplines to provide us with a multivariate perspective on climate extremes. The overarching goal of the dissertation is to improve the recognition and understanding of climate extremes and their impacts on vegetation by enabling a broader multivariate perspective, which complements existing approaches to the detection of extreme events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160049-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040708-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186270-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4502205-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187458-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113981-1>
Solving regularized total least squares problems based on eigenproblems ¤ BEGIN In the first part of the thesis we review basic knowledge of regularized least squares problems and present a significant acceleration of an existing method for the solution of trust-region problems. In the second part we present the basic theory of total least squares (TLS) problems and give an overview of possible extensions. Regularization of TLS problems by truncation and bidiagonalization approaches are briefly covered. Several approaches for solving the Tikhonov TLS problem based on Newtons method are mentioned, which lead to a converging sequence of linear systems. The emphasis of the thesis is on quadratically constrained TLS (RTLS) problems. Two different iterative concepts for the solution of the first-order condition are analyzed. The first iteration results in a sequence of quadratic problems while the second concept leads to a sequence of linear eigenvalue problems. For a fixed point iteration based on quadratic eigenvalue problems, i.e. the RTLSQEP method, the global convergence to the RTLS solution is proven. With the characterization of the rightmost eigenvalue of the QEPs the RTLS solution can be described via a generalized trust-region problem. The second concept has been studied in detail as well, i.e. the RTLSEVP method. To ensure convergence it was necessary to generalize the function g. The properties of this function have been heavily analyzed, which lead to a deeper understanding of the RTLS solution: It can also be characterized via the solution of a TLS problem. The RTLSQEP and RTLSEVP algorithm for solving the RTLS problem are shown to be very efficient when combined with iterative projection methods in the inner loop. Since a sequence of convergent problems has to be solved it turns out that the Nonlinear Arnoldi method is the method of choice, because it is able to recycle most of the information during the iterative process. The computational complexity of the proposed approaches is kept at the order of matrix-vector multiplications. We give a detailed description of an efficient implementation of the different parts of the algorithms. Two efficient algorithms for evaluating the L-curve at discrete points are presented. Since setting up the L-curve requires solving a sequence of RTLS problems the advantage of the Nonlinear Arnoldi method is even more apparent: Recycling the search space, not only within one RTLS problem but throughout the whole sequence.

Surface-Active Molecules for the Control of Surface Properties ¤ A fundamental understanding of the self-organization of surface-active molecules at the air-water interface is a necessary prerequisite to achieve a targeted control and application-oriented optimization of interfacial and surface properties. The present dissertation deals with systematic investigations of the surface activity of various amphiphilic substance systems (p-Terphenyl derivatives, 1-Acyl-1,2,4-triazoles) in the form of Langmuir films and Langmuir-Blodgett films, in order to clarify the behavior of surface-active molecules at the air-water interface. In addition to these basic investigations, practical investigations on the control of surface properties are carried out within the framework of an industrial research project on the optimization of nitrogen-sulfur fertilizer granules. In this context, the 1-Acyl-1,2,4-triazoles are used as nitrification inhibitors in a technical application example. surface-active molecules; Langmuir films; Langmuir-Blodgett films; collapse mechanism; Brewster angle microscopy; atomic force microscopy; p-terphenyl derivatives; 1-acyl-1,2,4-triazoles; N/S fertilizer granules; nitrification inhibitor	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245070-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158138-6>

Pore water biogeochemistry and trace metal dynamics in deep intertidal flat sediments ¤ Biogeochemical processes were studied in deep pore waters at different locations in the backbarrier area of Spiekeroog Island, Germany. A multilevel in situ pore water sampler was developed, which allows pore water sampling down to 5 m sediment depth. Sulphate, DOC, and nutrients were studied for the identification of organic matter remineralization pathways. Differences in sediment structure and hydrological conditions explain spatial variations in pore water depth profiles of margins compared to central parts of tidal flats as well as of sand and mixed flats. The deep pore water studies illustrate that seasonal variations of sulphate, DOC, and nutrients are not limited to the sediment surface. Seasonal variations of Mn, Fe, Mo, and U are by contrast limited to the upper decimetres of the sediment. Close to the tidal flat margin pore waters originating from some metres depth presumably escape at tidal flat margins at low tide thus representing a source for the ecosystem in the open water column. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182610-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125243-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288836-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189316-5>

Intervention Scenarios of Dementia Care: A Health Economic Modelling of the Cost- and Benefit Effects of Selected Intervention Concepts ¤ Dementia, Health Economics, Intervention, Modelling, Scenario Dementia is a challenge for many societies, especially in the light of demographic transition processes. This fact requires innovative care strategies. There are some public and academic proposals for dementia interventions, but a health economic study on costs and benefits has been missing, yet. This research paper investigates the economic impact of different intervention scenarios. For this purpose a markov modelling study was conducted that analyses different costs and benefits of interventions taking account of several perspectives (statutory health insurance, statutory care insurance, patients and caregivers) and care settings (home, group living, nursing home). The analyses show that some interventions could be efficient from societal perspective. However, certain interventions lead on to financial transfers between involved payers. The implementation of efficient interventions makes several structural changes in health care financing necessary.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011404-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162156-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194332-6>
Toxicological and immunological effects of DON and LPS at the intestinal barrier ¤ DON, LPS, Ussing-Chamber-Technique. - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DON-containing feed administered in vivo, directly applied DON in vitro, and in vivo intraperitoneally administered LPS on short-circuit currents and tissue conductance in the small intestine of growing pigs. In addition, in vitro measurements of DON transport across the intestinal epithelium were performed and an assessment of the immunological effects of DON and LPS was made by quantifying the stimulation of cytokine secretion in vivo. The study was conducted in two series. In the first series, sections from the duodenum, the middle jejunum, and the ileum of six pigs were used to investigate the in vitro effects of DON in various concentrations on short-circuit currents and tissue conductance of the intestinal epithelium in the presence and absence of alanine and glucose using the Ussing-Chamber-Technique. The results showed that DON in various concentrations affected short-circuit currents and tissue conductance of the intestinal epithelium. In addition, a significant stimulation of cytokine secretion in vivo was observed. In the second series, the in vitro effects of LPS on short-circuit currents and tissue conductance of the intestinal epithelium were investigated. The results showed that LPS in various concentrations affected short-circuit currents and tissue conductance of the intestinal epithelium. In addition, a significant stimulation of cytokine secretion in vivo was observed. The results of this study show that DON and LPS can affect intestinal barrier functions in various concentrations. This has important implications for the evaluation of the safety of feed and the development of strategies to reduce the effects of DON and LPS on the health of pigs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167802-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205701-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114339-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297820-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053848-5>
The PEP-Carboxylase in Poplars: Identification of the PEPC Gene Family and Overexpression in Populus x canescens ¤ Zusammenfassung: Short rotation coppices with fast growing tree species are expected to be planted more widely in the future to meet the growing demand for wood as renewable energy source. However, especially poplar trees are known to emit large amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene, which can effect the atmosphere chemistry of the troposphere in a negative way. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is an anaplerotic enzyme positioned at a metabolic crossing point between C- and N-metabolism of plant cells. It has been discussed that PEPC might also be involved in the regulation of the isoprene emission of plants. Both, the PEPC reaction and isoprene biosynthesis are dependend on the supply of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate, which led to the postulation of a competition for cytosolic PEP reserves between both processes. Thus, a stronger expression of PEPC should result in a reduction of isoprene emission and in an increase of amino acid synthesis and other parts of anabolic metabolism. PEPC is encoded by a gene family in plants but so far little is known about PEPC genes in poplar or other tree species. The aim of this study was to fill this gap by using two different approaches. One approach was to identify the PEPC gene family in poplar and to characterise the constituent genes by tissue specific and seasonal gene expression analyses. The other approach was supposed to create transgenic Grey Poplar plants (Populus x canescens) overexpressing a C3-PEPC gene from Flaveria trinervia. Three transgenic lines (13, 23, 25) were selected and investigated in terms of PEPC activity, biomass and gas exchange parameters, water balance, metabolites and isoprene emission. Furthermore, these lines were tested under drought stress conditions. Five PEPC genes were identified in Populus trichocarpa: Pt-PEPC.1, Pt-PEPC.2 and Pt-PEPC.3 represented typical plant type PEPCs, while Pt-PEPC.4 and Pt-PEPC.5 belonged to the so called bacterial type PEPCs. The gene pairs Pt-PEPC.1 and 2 as well as Pt-PEPC.4 and 5 exhibited very high identity rates of over 93 % to each other, while Pt-PEPC.3 grouped independently of both pairs. All essential amino acid residues were highly conserved. The C-terminal region of each gene was cloned and sequenced for Populus x canescens. Based on these sequence information, qPCR primers for gene expression analyses in Populus x cancescens were designed. The genes Pc-PEPC.2 and especially Pc-PEPC.1 were expressed most ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4462312-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4291704-9>
Calculation of Selected Quality Parameters of Electrical Energy as Planning Basis for Electrical Energy Supply Systems ¤ To ensure conformity in electrical energy supply systems, it is necessary to include electrical energy quality in the planning process of networks and facilities. The quality parameters of electrical energy must be economically determinable by suitable calculation programs. The necessary requirements for such a calculation program, the required mathematical procedures, as well as the modeling of the operating materials of the networks and the consumers are derived and implemented in the SALOMON program system. In addition, methodological guidelines are given that allow for efficient use of the program technology, but also ensure that the accuracy requirements for determining the electrical energy quality parameters are fully met. With three case studies, it is shown how investigations for the evaluation of electrical energy quality should be carried out during the planning of electrical engineering facilities and networks, and how the SALOMON program system can be used appropriately in this context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246872-3>

The modern portfolio theory applied to wind farm investments ¤ In a context of research of alternatives to improve investments in renewable energy sources, this work addresses the Modern Portfolio Theory when applied to investments in wind farms. The Modern Portfolio Theory describes how the combination of assets subject to different characteristics of risk x return leads to optimized portfolios of investments. Grounded on the principles of diversification, the theory has been originally developed to assess investments in financial assets. In view of the intrinsic differences between financial assets and a physical asset such as a wind farm, this work investigates the limits of a theory developed to manage risk in securities when applied to wind farm investments. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4543294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012539-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1201428653>

Contributions to the Development of a Driver Assistance System for Parking Maneuvers ¤ This contribution documents the further development of the standard parking aid (obstacle warning) to a semi-autonomous (lat. partially self-contained) parking assistant. In this assistance function, tasks are largely automated during parking; however, the driver's involvement is deliberately not dispensed with. Thus, man is not only a user and operator, but also a system component with its own sensors and actuators as an integrated part. The current development of driver assistance systems shows that new functions can only be successfully established if the relationship between man and machine and the required interfaces are taken into account during development. Accordingly, the challenge in system design is to identify the needs of the driver and support him by taking over partial tasks. The process from the idea to the first use of the product prototype in test drives is described. Based on a parking study, the concrete requirements were recorded on the basis of the desired assistance by the drivers as user requirements. This made it possible to concentrate the development work on the driver's needs. In the requirements analysis, the results of a study on parking behavior are discussed, which includes user surveys, observation, and parking statistics. From the functional design, the components (operating principles and solution elements) were derived. The functional design provides for the environment detection using ultrasonic sensors and the position determination by internal vehicle sensors. Two different system designs are discussed: In the first variant, the driver is provided with information via a suitable man-machine interface on how to steer and drive in order to optimally (subjectively easier for the driver) enter the parking space. In the second variant, steering is automatically performed using an electromechanical steering system (Electric Power Steering), and the driver is only responsible for longitudinal guidance. Alternatives for calculating the parking trajectory, experiences in designing the man-machine interface, and lane-following control concepts are presented for the variants. After the implementation of the planned system, it is again up to the drivers to uncover defects and errors in the use of the system and to evaluate the expected acceptance. For this purpose, user tests were carried out with the system prototypes. The results show a high validity due to the high reality factor and the immediate experience. In this targeted approach, therefore, a driver-centered development is spoken of.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076001-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044677-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4622983-8>
Continuous mixing of silica based rubber/filler-composites in twin screw extruder ¤ Manufacturing processes of rubber compounds for tire components significantly affect the performance and quality of tires. One of the standard processes is the mixing of silica with organosilane and rubber in an internal mixer. Due to the chemical reaction between silica and organosilane, the process typically involves several stages and is particularly time-consuming. By using rubber/filler composites (RFC) with silica and continuous mixing process, mixing time and mixing energy can be significantly reduced. This work describes the principles of continuous mixing based on experiments in a twin screw extruder. It investigates the mixing of RFC based on E-SBR/silica/silan, S-SBR/silica/silan, and BR/silica/silan together with cross-linking chemicals. It shows the relationships between process parameters such as screw geometry, dosing construction, screw speed, throughput, and filler content and mixing and vulcanization properties (e.g. filler-filler interaction, tensile strength, and wear). Finally, investigations from mixing experiments in a twin screw extruder in combination with a transfermix extruder and gear pump are presented. The summarized results of this work show that the continuous mixing process is a suitable and advantageous technology for the production of silica-filled rubber compounds and rubber blends. Optimization of screw geometry and process parameters is necessary. Under these conditions, the continuous mixing process can be realized as a one-stage or two-stage process.

Using micromagnetic spin dynamics simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and effective equations of motion, an optimization of the skyrmion-based racetrack data storage device is proposed. Here, spin-orbit torques are manipulated to suppress the skyrmion Hall effect. Moreover, the existence of individual biskyrmions, as well as periodic lattices of magnetic bimerons and antiferromagnetic skyrmions are predicted. By utilizing the Berry theory and the Landauer-Büttiker approach, the topological Hall effect of electrons and the magnetoelectric properties of skyrmions are quantified. Furthermore, a purely topologically induced Hall effect of electrons in bimeron crystals and a topological spin Hall effect of electrons in antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals are predicted.

The book introduces from a sociological perspective the general conditions of inclusion and the risks of exclusion in modern society and concretizes these at the example of the living situation of people with disabilities. On the basis of a detailed analysis and criticism of the welfare state models and concepts for the treatment of their special exclusion risks, new approaches to an effective design of rehabilitation services are shown and discussed	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044789-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117641-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112696-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>
Further characterization of the breeding of the Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J mouse strain, as well as evaluation of an oral inoculation model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa with regard to its suitability for antipseudomonal vaccine studies ¤ Cystic Fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, nasal vaccination. - Patients with the monogenic inherited disease Cystic Fibrosis often suffer from an infection with the multi-resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the advanced stage of their disease. In fact, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in CF patients is considered the leading cause of death (PAUL et al. 2001). Consequently, preventing such colonization would be an important step to improve the quality of life and survival of such patients. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made in the past to develop an antipseudomonal vaccine (DORING u. PIER 2008). Since infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is primarily acquired through the nasal-pharyngeal space (KUBESCH et al. 1988), the failure of previous vaccine studies may be explained by the fact that the application of the respective vaccine has always been carried out solely systemically to date, and thus also the antibody response occurred systemically. In the present work, a recombinant OprF-I- vaccine was investigated for its efficacy in the mouse model, which could be applied both directly systemically and mucosally in the form of a nasal gel (BAUMANN et al. 2004). Due to the corrected CF intestinal pathology, mice of the Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J strain were chosen as experimental animals (ZHOU et al. 1994). The oral inoculation model according to Coleman et al (COLEMAN et al. 2003) served as the infection model. Before the actual vaccine study began, the...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169148-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026655-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047651-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140660-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040669-6>

Molecular Function of the Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel hNav1.9 ¤ BEGIN The SCN11A gene encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV-channel) NaV1.9. This channel exhibits the greatest differences in sequence and gating behavior within the NaV-channel family (NaV1.1- NaV1.9). The channel cannot trigger action potentials due to its unique properties. NaV1.9 is expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and is associated with the sensitization of tissue during inflammatory processes. An isolated study of heterologously expressed NaV1.9 channels has been impossible in non-neuronal cells so far. However, this is necessary to clarify the relationships between the SCN11A mutation L811P and the disturbed pain perception in patients with congenital analgesia. To this end, domains and hNaV1.9 channels were functionally investigated using electrophysiological methods in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The C-terminus of NaV1.9 was identified as the trigger for the poor heterologous expression of NaV1.9 and as responsible for the unique NaV1.9 gating behavior. Therefore, a NaV1.9 construct was developed, which can be expressed in non-neuronal cells and used for pharmacological investigation of NaV1.9 channels. It was shown that the mutation L811P significantly increases channel activity and affects the resting membrane potential of DRG neurons. In addition, the other disturbed bodily functions of patients with L811P mutation (gastrointestinal motility, motor function, sweating) suggest an abundant physiological role of the NaV1.9 channel in many tissues and in many physiological processes in humans. Furthermore, NaV1.9 could function as a target molecule in pain therapy.

Planning and Optimization of Flow Assembly Systems : A Contribution Considering Changing Requirements for Process Reliability, Product Quality, and Flexibility ¤ Originally, the design of assembly systems in the form of flow systems aimed at a consistently high volume of a single product with a high degree of automation. Due to reasons such as continuously increasing customer demands or changes in sales, assembly processes are constantly adapted to the changed conditions. Such requirements have an impact on the structure and design of flow assembly systems. As a result, aspects such as redundancy, buffering, and the integration of quality stations gain importance in planning such systems. New methods are therefore developed to improve the configuration and operation of post-processing loops, converging and diverging, and parallel structures. The developed structures exhibit more advantages in terms of flexibility, redundancy, availability, utilization rate, and buffer capacities compared to conventional structures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212485-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120760-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154634-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4432973-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154615-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4731131-9>
Frugal Innovations : An Examination of the Criteria and the Approach in Product Development ¤ Criteria for defining frugal innovation -- Design of the innovation process -- Procedure for identifying customer needs -- Procedure for concept development. . Timo Weyrauch examines which criteria define a frugal innovation and how frugal innovations can be developed. In the first part of the investigation, three criteria are developed on the basis of a literature review and a qualitative survey to distinguish frugal from non-frugal innovations. In the second part, the innovation and product development process is investigated using action research. The author shows how frugal innovations can be targeted developed with which procedures and methods.

Analysis of genotypic differences in biochemical and physiological adjustments to N-deficiency and drought stress in potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) with consideration of yield components ¤ This work aimed at comprehensive phenotyping of potato cultivars in response to N-deficiency and drought stress at the morphological, physiological and biochemical level. 17 European potato cultivars were investigated in two years pot trials in a rainout shelter with two N-levels and two water supply regimes. Additionally, a broad in vitro screening was performed to monitor specific traits under different N-levels. Furthermore, out of these two contrasting genotypes were analysed in a proteomic approach to identify proteins associated with genotype specific responses to N-deficiency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029804-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186270-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345147-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4576155-3>
Digital reading : Change and Continuity of a Literary Practice ¤ What is digital reading? How do readers cope with the digital abundance of offers? Individual coping mechanisms often no longer suffice to master this challenge, and the hype around digital media obscures the view of their tradition. Therefore, the development of stable reading strategies and media competence requires a systematic historical and scientific description of the phenomenon. From the synthesis of reading act theory, materiality and media research, as well as practice theory, Franziska Wilke develops a reading typology that illustrates reading digital literature. Her gained insights are not only useful for readers, but also for those who want to become readers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035439-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431027-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273696-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4680767-6>

Acquisition of Modeling Competences: Empirical Comparison of a Holistic and an Atomistic Approach to Promoting Modeling Competences ¤ The acquisition of mathematical modeling competences is compulsory in Germany since their fixation in the educational standards for students of all school forms and levels. Susanne Brand compares a holistic and a dissecting modeling approach to promote modeling competences empirically within the framework of the intervention project ERMO. Her results show that the effectiveness of the two examined approaches must be considered differently, especially in view of the performance strength and -heterogeneity of learning groups.

Control in Organizations ¤ How can control in organizations be theoretically appropriately captured? Action theories draw on individual actors and social structures to explain (control) action, while system theory draws on social structures and interaction processes. According to the initial hypothesis of the book, each theory neglects an important aspect of determining social (control) action: action theories neglect the determination by ongoing interaction processes and system theory neglects the determination by the individual actor. It shows that control in organizations is a complex phenomenon that is viewed differently by various theories. This work aims to contribute to clarifying this question.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043774-7>

Investigating the feasibility of accelerated drug release testing for intravaginal rings ¤ Wirkstofffreisetzung, accelerated drug release testing, vaginal rings, diffusion, quality control Accelerated drug release tests are essential for quality control (QC) of long acting (non-oral) controlled release formulations. Real-time release experiments are usually required for product development, to understand the mechanism of release and to establish a correlation with in vivo release. Ideally, the accelerated test should maintain the biorelevant aspect of the in vitro method and the mechanism of release should not change under accelerated test conditions. At the same time adequate discriminatory ability is a prerequisite as the accelerated test should be able to discriminate between batches with respect to manufacturing variables that can impact on bioavailability. The objective of this thesis was to develop accelerated drug release tests for intravaginal rings (IVRs) and to gain a mechanistic understanding of the principles that facilitate in vitro drug release under accelerated test conditions. A detailed evaluation of the in vitro release characteristics of the formulations under real-time test conditions was considered as a prerequisite for developing predictive accelerated tests. Two formulations were subject of this study, in which the mechanism of release is primarily governed by drug diffusion. One formulation was the commercially available Nuvaring®, a combined hormonal contraceptive IVR that releases etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol with a constant rate over a duration of 3 weeks. The second formulation was a prototype of an investigational IVR that is ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187312-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047968-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012277-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070794-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190018-2>

Foreign Exchange Market Efficiency: An Empirical Investigation of High-Frequency Exchange Rate Reactions to Macroeconomic Publications ¤ The foreign exchange market is considered the most traded, liquid, and technologically advanced financial market worldwide. So, trading in foreign currencies attracts a large number of highly professional market participants who can react to changes in market data in the shortest time possible using modern electronic communication tools. The present monograph focuses on the question of whether this is actually the case in the context of newly published macroeconomic information, by analyzing the ultra-high-frequency reaction of the most important US dollar exchange rates in the second. To this end, a comprehensive presentation of the functioning of the foreign exchange market and the principles of exchange rate formation is first provided. Further content highlights concern the processing of information on financial markets, the concept of market efficiency, and the event study methodology.

Social Work and Systems Theories ¤ System theory is currently a dominant paradigm of the scientific discourse. In the context of Social Work, systems thinking has become known primarily as a counseling concept. Furthermore, the adoption of systemic approaches is also associated with the expectation of a stronger independent profiling of a theory of Social Work. The author examines the various stages of development of system theory and its reception within Social Work and inquires about their applicability on different levels of theory formation of Social Work, from interaction to societal functional determination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>

Intergenerational Divorce Transmission in Germany : the Search for the "missing link" between Divorce in the Parent Generation and Divorce in the Child Generation ¤ The starting point of the present investigation is the repeatedly replicated finding from the USA, that persons who experienced the divorce of their parents in childhood or youth have a higher divorce risk compared to persons who did not experience this, in comparison. The goal of the present work was to determine whether the as "intergenerational divorce transmission" described connection between divorce in the parent generation and divorce in the child generation is also to be proven in Germany, and - if this were the case - how this connection is to be explained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013656-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202105-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014516-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237994-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137578-6>
Network Management in Trade: Process Innovations in Trade Using RFID Technology as an Example ¤ Introduction -- Introduction -- Challenges in Trade -- Competition through new business forms -- Developments in the trade environment -- Process innovations in trade — Reaction to the pressure for efficiency in trade -- Trade processes as a starting point -- Process innovations in trade to increase efficiency -- Network management in trade — Management of a network for the introduction of a cross-company process innovation -- Network structures — The network as an organizational form for the introduction of a cross-company process innovation in trade -- Control mechanisms — Control of a network for the introduction of a cross-company process innovation in trade. Network management is not only of great importance for companies in the trade sector, but also associated with significant challenges. In particular, when introducing cross-company process innovations such as, for example, RFID technology, management within and by networks plays a central role. Thomas C. Salditt shows a selection of current challenges for the trade sector, which increase the pressure for efficiency on individual traders. Cross-company process innovations such as RFID technology can be used to counter this pressure. Business networks and the management of these networks are a central aspect here. The author places trade processes and process innovations in the context of network relationships and derives concrete recommendations for management in networks from this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245322-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023226-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509863-3>
A Design Methodology for Data Warehouses ¤ Recently, data warehouses (DWHs) as a decision support system's core caused a lively interest in research as well as in practice. Decisions based on the DHW and their consequences, respectively, are often far-reaching. Therefore, the underlying database has to fulfill some specific quality criteria. This doctoral thesis proposes a method for designing DWHs which is based on the three level approach. For conceptual modelling the language MML (Multidimensional Modeling Language) is defined. MML features multidimensional as well as object oriented constructs. It is supplemented by the graphical notation mUML, a multidimensional extension of the UML. After the transformation to the logical layer is realised, physical design of the database schema is treated in depth. Furthermore, the prototypical implementation of the concepts is described and the method is evaluated using a real world example.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4406462-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127613-9>
On the cycle spaces associated to orbits of semi-simple Lie Groups ¤ Let G be a semi-simple Lie group and Q a parabolic subgroup of its complexification GC, then Z = GC/Q is a complex GC-fan manifold. The group G, just like the complexification KC of the maximal compact subgroup of GC, acts on Z with only finitely many orbits. For every G-orbit ' there exists a KC-orbit ·, such that the average ' is not empty and compact. By considering the properties of cycles at the boundary of G-orbits, a definition of the cycle space of any G-orbit was given. By means of Schubert varieties, Schubert cuts and with the help of a certain complementary hypersurface, the complete characterization of all cycle spaces, associated to a G-orbit ', was given. In particular, all cycle spaces, with a few exceptions in the Hermitian case, are equivalent to the region ƯAG. In the exceptional cases, the cycle space is equivalent to the associated restricted region.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112729-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4512043-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4629829-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184206-6>

Fermions in curved spacetimes ¤ In this dissertation, we investigate a formulation of Dirac fermions in curved spacetimes that possesses both general coordinate invariance and local spin basis invariance. We illuminate the benefits of the spin basis invariant formulation from a conceptual and practical perspective. Using the spin basis formalism, we construct a field theory for quantized gravity and matter fields and show that the quantization of the metric and matter fields suffices. For field theoretical approaches to quantum gravity, this observation is of particular relevance, as it suggests a purely metric-based quantization scheme, even in the presence of fermions. Therefore, we investigate in the second part of this work the gauge and field parameter dependence of the renormalization group flow in quantum gravity theories.

Failed Integration Processes after Serving a Juvenile/Prison Sentence from an Identity-Theoretical Perspective ¤ The qualitative study titled „Failed Integration Processes after Serving a Juvenile/Prison Sentence from an Identity-Theoretical Perspective“ aims to utilize identity constructions as a theoretical framework and reference point for social integration processes. The methodological and methodical framework for approaching this subject area is the Grounded Theory Methodology. The analytical focus is on identity constructions of a selected group of inmates who have experienced repeated incarceration and, as a result, exhibit certain characteristic combinations. In particular, negative experience values 'with' society and socialization institutions prompt subjects to open up their own biography and social positioning for a self-referential discourse. In this process, social experiences of disregard are worked through, interpretable as an attempt to establish normalization and affiliation capabilities, which then merge into a functional form of identity work, oriented towards 'Authenticity' (core category), in the institutional context. This form of identity work elevates the refusal to comply with societal integration requirements as a constitutive element of one's individualized identity project. This articulation practice is initially limited to the time of imprisonment. The subjects enter their re-release with the claim to document successful integration; however, the authentic construction logic is no longer suitable to establish expectation security in the course of re-release, in order to realize 'successful' identity work outside the institution, which makes re-incarceration attractive: The 'return' to the prison institution stands in the context of increasing experiences of alienation, which convey to the subjects the progressive exclusion, explicitly in the function of an inclusive disintegration, and can, in addition, counteract a threatening identity damage in a self-image-friendly manner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027238-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162867-6>

Influence of two progesterone-releasing preparations (PRID®alpha, CIDR®) on the synchronization of recipient animals in the context of an embryo transfer program in cattle ¤ Synchronisation, Progesterone, Embryo transfer. - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two progesterone-releasing preparations (PRID alpha Spiral and CIDR Spange) on the endometrium of recipient animals and the influence of the medication duration on the progesterone level, synchronization success, and pregnancy rates after ET. For this purpose, a total of 104 heifers of the German Fleckvieh breed were synchronized at the recipient animal station Brandhof of the Neustadt / Aisch e.V. breeding association. The group allocation was as follows: Group 1A 33 animals (synchronization using PRID Spiral, medication duration 8 days), Group 1B 34 animals (synchronization using CIDR Spange, medication duration 8 days), Group 2A 11 animals (synchronization using PRID, medication duration 9 days) and Group 2B 13 animals (synchronization using CIDR, medication duration 9 days). All animals received a prostaglandin injection 24 hours before the removal of the preparations (Groups 1A and 1B on day 7, Groups 2A and 2B on day 8). Estrus occurred approximately 48 hours (day 10 of the experiment) after removal of the preparations. The animals were then either fertilized with an embryo or an egg and the pregnancy rates were checked after 30 days. The results showed that the synchronization of recipient animals using PRID and CIDR was successful and significantly increased the pregnancy rates after ET. The medication duration had no significant influence on the synchronization success and pregnancy rates. The results of this study can contribute to the optimization of embryo transfer programs in cattle breeding.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130847-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050061-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113430-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175834-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127390-4>
Methodical Material and Process Development for Additive Series Production of Automotive Structural Components ¤ The powder bed-based laser beam melting process (LPBF) offers the possibility of creating end-conforming and highly complex metallic structures. In combination with flexible material systems, a variant-rich, load-path-optimized, and lot-independent component production is realizable, which is of particular interest for the automotive industry with a variety of vehicle derivatives and consistent lightweight design concepts. Currently, a widespread dissemination in the body-in-white construction is not yet given. In addition to the frequently limited formability of the materials, the lack of knowledge about the application behavior, in particular with regard to crash and corrosion, is a barrier to innovation in the framework of the extensive release processes of the automotive manufacturers. This work presents a systematic knowledge base for the applicability of existing and novel aluminum alloys for automotive series applications. Furthermore, methodical approaches and recommendations for action are given for the extended series integration of the technology. The content Systematic knowledge base for the applicability of additive manufacturing in automotive body-in-white construction Innovative methods and approaches for the accelerated development of novel material systems Material and process optimization with regard to crash-related loading cases and corrosive application conditions The author Andreas Lutz studied mechanical engineering with a focus on methodical product development and production technology at the University of Ulm and the Technical University of Berlin. He graduated in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Claus Emmelmann at the Institute for Laser and System Technology (iLAS) of the Technical University of Hamburg. During his doctoral studies, he was employed as a doctoral researcher in the corporate research of Mercedes-Benz AG from 2017 to 2020.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4799497-6>
Carsharing and the Society of Tomorrow : An Environmentally Conscious Approach to Automobility? ¤ Based on a quantitative survey of approximately 1,500 young people and young adults from Baden-Württemberg, Sarah Witzke shows a cautious trend regarding the intention to use car-sharing vehicles instead of their own cars in the future. She shows that the ownership of a private vehicle is of great importance for this group. Through a linear regression calculation, central influencing factors regarding the car-sharing intention were identified. In particular, the influence of significant third parties, perceived car-sharing availability, and awareness of the environmentally burdensome effect of motorized individual traffic are thus decisive. The content Problem outline: Sustainable mobility as a challenge of the future Car-sharing – a classic example of shared consumption The youth and the concept of car-sharing Theoretical explanation models for mode choice Quantitative main study: Car-sharing as an alternative to the private car? The target groups Lecturers and students of economics, social sciences, and mobility research Professionals and executives from the automotive industry, car-sharing providers The author Sarah Witzke is employed as a scientific assistant at the Institute for Sustainable Corporate Management at the University of Ulm. In particular, the mobility of young people and young adults, as well as the mobility concept of car-sharing, are at the center of her research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062632-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072431-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073757-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013943-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134274-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062901-6>
Methods for learning structured prediction in semantic segmentation of natural images ¤ Automatic segmentation and recognition of semantic classes in natural images is an important open problem of machine vision. In this work, we investigate three possible approaches to recognition: without supervision, with supervision at the image level, and with supervision at the pixel level. This work consists of three parts. In the first part of the work, we propose a clustering algorithm that optimizes a novel, information-theoretic objective function. We show that the presented algorithm has clear advantages over standard procedures from the literature on many different datasets. Clustering is an important component in many applications of machine vision, especially in automatic segmentation. The second part of this work presents a procedure for automatic segmentation and recognition of object classes in natural images, which is able to learn a segmentation model with the help of supervision in the form of class occurrences on images. The third part of the work investigates one of the most widely used approaches to semantic segmentation and object class segmentation, Conditional Random Fields, connected with procedures of structured prediction. We investigate various learning algorithms of structured learning, especially in connection with approximate prediction. We show that it is possible to learn exact structured models for image segmentation despite the presence of circles in the considered neighborhood graphs. With the presented methods, we advance the state of the art on two complex datasets for semantic segmentation, the MSRC-21 dataset of RGB images and the NYU V2 dataset of RGB-D images of indoor scenes. We also present a software library that allows for a comprehensive comparison of the best learning procedures for structured learning to be performed. Our study allows us to characterize the considered algorithms in a range of applications, especially semantic segmentation and object class segmentation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145448-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129594-8>
Palladium-catalyzed Functionalization and Cyclization as well as Acid-Mediated Cyclization of Quinoline Derivatives ¤ The thesis deals with palladium-catalyzed as well as Brønsted acid mediated cylization of quinolines. The indoloquinolines were synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura-reaction, followed by Buchwald-Hartwig Amination. The syntheses of benzoacridines and benzophenanthridines as well as the benzoindolizinonaphthyridines were carried out via palladium-catalyzed reactions and a following Brønsted acid mediated cyloisomerization.

From Protease to Peptidase: The Influence of the Oxyanion Hole on Reverse Proteolysis at the Example of Trypsin ¤ The enzymatic ligation of peptide and protein fragments presents a significant challenge. Among other things, suitable biocatalysts are lacking, which exhibit both sufficient interaction with the peptide backbone and catalyze the formation of a peptide bond. Lars Franke investigates the possibility of transferring the excellent ligation properties of Surfactin-Thioesterase II to anionic rat trypsin II, which in turn shows a suitable interaction with the peptide backbone. While the catalytic mechanisms of both enzymes essentially correspond to those of serine esterases, there is a difference in the architecture of the oxyanion hole. Corresponding oxyanion hole mutants of trypsin were generated, their catalytic properties were investigated, and their utility for enzymatic ligation reactions was quantified. As a result, the author was able to generate two trypsin variants that are suitable for peptide ligation and protein modification. The content includes: Anthropogenic protein synthesis Enzymes for enzymatic peptide synthesis Generation and purification of trypsin variants Kinetic parameters of the acyl transfer reaction and protein modification The target groups include researchers and students of biochemistry and enzymology Enzymologists and peptide chemists in industrial research and development The author Lars Franke is active in the development of custom-made enzymes for peptide synthesis and protein modification at the Charles-Tannford-Protein Center in Halle.

Validation of Biomagnetic Procedures at Isotropic and Anisotropic Volume Conduction in a Torso Phantom ¤ In this work, the accuracy and reproducibility of biomagnetic procedures were investigated. Biomagnetic measurements were performed with a vector biomagnetometer on a realistic, complex, partially anisotropic torso phantom. Various detailed computer models could be examined. The reconstruction of a single dipole during simultaneous activity of other dipoles could be successfully performed with a torso phantom. The used RAP-MUSIC algorithm could be successfully validated as a current method for source reconstruction. Circular and spiral-shaped currents were systematically investigated in different manifestations as a possible source for differences in magnetic and electrical data. It could be shown how the circular or spiral shape affects the magnetic flux density and the electrical potentials.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171740-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006876-6>
Operational Flexibility Planning Model: A Reference Model for Manufacturing Enterprises in the Photovoltaic Industry ¤ Practice, especially the photovoltaic industry, is confronted with barely predictable demand fluctuations, in short volatility, to which it is necessary to react flexibly. In theory, flexibility research goes back to the beginnings of business administration, and flexibility is now demanded by entire value chains. Nevertheless, there is still a lack in business literature of a theoretically founded, comprehensive, and at the same time practical approach model that offers a guide for systematic flexibility planning. In the present work, such an approach model for systematic operational flexibility planning is developed at the example of the photovoltaic industry, which also represents a reference model for any value-adding production systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268390-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7856923-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047360-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076362-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041036-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125037-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418272-7>
Operational Regulations in the Railway Noise Protection System: A Critical Inventory of the Administrative Noise Protection Powers in Railway Planning and Railway Hazard Prevention Law ¤ Noise pollution caused by rail traffic is a topic of lasting social, economic, and political relevance. One possibility for reducing this unwanted side effect can be the administrative order of operational regulatory measures – for example, speed or passage restrictions –. The work analyzes the most relevant legal questions in this context under national and European law. The focus is on railway planning. The legal situation outside of specialized planning is also examined. On this basis, further potential reform possibilities are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062942-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046222-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026611-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014015-5>
Microstructural Properties of Quartz as Part of Late-Reactive, Alkali-Sensitive Additives ¤ Between the years 1920 and 1930, there were structural damages to bridges and roads along the California coast, which mainly manifested in a clear cracking. Since then, structural damages have been repeatedly described, whose cause is seen in the reaction of additives containing reactive silica with the pore solution of the concrete. This reaction is referred to as the Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). Since the first publication by Stanton on the alkali-aggregate reaction on opal-containing additives, hundreds of research works have been conducted on this topic and their results have been published. Despite extensive research for more than 80 years, neither the mechanism of ASR is fully clarified nor is a clear prediction of the threat to buildings or building components with potentially ASR-sensitive additives possible. This is mainly due to the fact that ASR is a reaction that consists of a complex sequence of chemical and physical processes, which can lead to damage to concrete or concrete components and buildings in their entirety. A closed description and treatment of this reaction is not possible as long as no satisfactory knowledge of the sequence of individual steps is available. This requires fundamental investigations of the individual chemical and physical reaction steps as well as a quantitative evaluation of the various influencing factors. In general, there are a wide range of guidelines and standards worldwide that are intended to prevent damage to buildings by ASR. In Germany, the current valid rulebook is the so-called Alkali Guideline of the German Committee for Reinforced Concrete (DAfStb).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213943-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048011-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134383-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238916-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131028-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194368-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178306-2>
Development Systematics of Thermal Management for High-Quality LED Systems ¤ The demand for increasingly powerful LED systems while simultaneously limited space requires increasing demands on thermal management. Not only the lifespan, but also optical properties, such as light flux and color, depend on the LED chip temperature. As a result of a pronounced temperature dependence, the development process of LED systems is very complex. This complexity arises due to the larger number of interconnected elements, which are realized in different disciplines. Due to this fact, there is a need for a cross-disciplinary development process that takes into account the tasks, problems, and requirements of all disciplines. Within the scope of this work, a possible integration of the disciplines relevant to the error-free functionality of thermal management with the engineering approach in product development was specified. The result is a systematics that structures the development process of LED systems and assigns suitable methods and tools of thermal management. The applicability of the development systematics was presented using the design of two demonstrators. In this context, it was shown that the interaction of the various disciplines opens up potential for the design of new products and applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064211-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139402-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125154-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035633-4>

Svenja Maria Schenk undertakes a cross-sectional investigation of corresponding moral and moral-related general clauses in intellectual property law. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the systematics of European and German intellectual property law, she works out the function and special importance of these norms for the appropriateness of the protection systems and the free competition in view of ever new (technological) developments. She deals with existing uncertainties, differences and fields of tension and contributes to the legal security for applicants and legal practitioners through the proposal of concrete application principles for practice. In the following, she submits a new, uniform understanding of the concept of morality in intellectual property law and also addresses the procedural consequences of this proposal.Inhalts&uuml;bersichtIntroduction A.

EasyKit : a development methodology for rapid engineering of miniaturized mechatronic systems ¤ The current development of mechatronic systems is mostly characterized by a sequential design process of electronics, software, and mechanics. At the same time, the domain-specific design often requires development tools in individual fields, which require a high level of expert knowledge and are only partially compatible with each other. The EasyKit development methodology aims to simplify this development process through modularization on the hardware and software level. For this purpose, tools are provided to the user, which have already been infused with extensive expert knowledge, so that he can develop and build the hardware and software for mechatronic systems independently with simple means and basic knowledge. This work describes these tools and the associated technologies. Various possibilities for a solvable connection of electronic components are presented. In addition, a interface concept in the form of an external bus is shown, with which electronic function carriers can be easily stacked on top of each other. Existing templates for the PCB layout and test adapters support this approach. Another major goal of this work is to accelerate and make the development process more economical. For this purpose, a three-stage model has been developed, which enables a simple transition from the functional pattern (Stage 1) to the small series (Stage 2) to the series product (Stage 3). The existing function blocks in hardware and software lead to a rapid construction of first functional patterns. Through the reuse of these function blocks in all three stages, the transition from the functional pattern to the series product can be strongly accelerated. This concept has also been transferred to software. Through a graphical programming interface and available function libraries, programs and executable codes are significantly easier to generate. Two practical examples, a temperature measurement system and a regulated pneumatic cylinder, illustrate the complete design process and show advantages and disadvantages. A cost comparison with the conventional approach highlights the economic benefits of the development methodology.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221617-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126945-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205811-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125467-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389159-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238812-0>
Novel cationic esters from cellulose and dextran : synthesis, structure analysis and properties ¤ The goal of the work was the synthesis of new water-soluble aminogroup-containing cellulose and dextran carboxylic acid esters under homogeneous reaction conditions. The ring-opening reaction of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidon (NMP) in the presence of p-Toluensulfonic acid chloride resulted in the chlorides of cellulose-4-[N-methylammonium]butyrate (with average substitution degrees, DS, of 0.31 to 1.04), hydroxyethyl cellulose-4-[N-methylammonium]butyrate (with DS values of 0.28 to 0.98) and dextran-4-[N-methylammonium]butyrate (with DS values between 0.12 and 0.72). Cellulose-4-[N,N,N-trimethylammonium]butyrate chloride could be produced by the reaction of cellulose with (3-Carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride under activation with N,N'-Carbonyldiimidazole. N,N-Dimethylacetamide/LiCl and BMIMCl served as reaction media. High reaction temperatures (up to 100°C) and reaction times (up to 20 h) were necessary to synthesize products with DS values between 0.17 and 0.75.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075421-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151986-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431018-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147310-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307316-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156414-5>
Combination of Nanofabrication and Nanometrology on a planar Ø100 mm Nanofabrication Machine (NFM-100) ¤ The demand for high-precision positioning for the application of nanofabrication in macroscopic work areas is steadily increasing. Due to a new level of complexity in micro- and nanoelectronic manufacturing, extreme requirements for high-precision nanopositioning over areas up to 100 mm and their combination with high-efficiency nanostructuring processes are necessary. In the last few decades, numerous alternative methods have established themselves in comparison to optical lithography for the generation of nanostructures. For highly accurate nanostructuring and measurement, sharp-based technologies offer a significant advantage compared to other methods. However, the usual movement range of sharp-based systems is usually limited to a few hundred µm². The goal of the present work is to transfer the previously small-scale nanostructuring by a Fowler-Nordheim emission current to wafer sizes up to 4 inches based on an ultra-precise nanopositioning and nanomeasuring platform. Through the unique combination of planar nanopositioning technology with a sharp-based system, the movement ranges can be expanded by a factor of 10^6 to 10^8. The use of active microcantilevers allows for an arbitrary switch between scanning force microscopy and scanning probe lithography modes. After characterizing and optimizing the planar nanofabrication machine, targeted and comprehensive studies of the sharp-based system follow to be able to combine both systems optimally. Subsequently, various experiments are presented through the combination of the systems for large-area scanning, where the demonstration of macroscopic AFM scans up to 100 mm is in focus. Comprehensive studies on nanofabrication over macroscopic areas follow. With this, the successful synergy of the two technologies has been proven. The relationships of reproducibility, precision, and tip wear are intensively investigated. Also, processing length and maximum scanning speeds are analyzed and discussed. To demonstrate the usability of the generated nanostructures with the NFM-100, a possible pattern transfer for the application of further nanofabrication processes such as nanoimprint lithography has been successfully demonstrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191584-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274473-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121259-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327473-0>

Functional Nanoparticles Based on Cellulose ¤ Novel polysaccharide nanoparticles (PS-NP) were developed and their application as sensors was investigated. Hydrophobic dyes were incorporated into PS-NP from cellulose esters during self-assembly. The particle properties of the composite-NP are influenced both by the hydrophobicity of the dyes and by structural interactions. By comparing the two production methods – dialysis and dropwise addition – particle size and the width of the size distribution of the composite-NP were optimized. Carboxyl groups on the particle surface were covalently coupled with antibodies to obtain colored conjugates. The conjugates showed lower detection limits in the lateral flow immunoassay than corresponding reference particles. Furthermore, cellulose esters with active ester groups based on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were synthesized under homogeneous conditions. N,N'-Disuccinimidylcarbonate proved to be an effective reagent. The derivatives could be converted into reactive PS-NP with activated NHS groups on the surface, to which an aminofunctionalized fluorescent dye or enzyme could be covalently immobilized directly and without the usual activation step in aqueous phase. Optimized reaction conditions allow the dye to be bound with high efficiency of up to 90%. For the conversion of 6-maleimidohexanoic acid with cellulose esters, iminium chloride proved to be an effective reagent. During the conversion to particles, a thiol-functionalized dye could be bound to the derivatives via thiol-ene reaction (click chemistry) to obtain fluorescent and reactive PS-NP. The obtained PS derivatives were characterized using elemental analysis, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while the PS-NP were investigated using dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and optical spectroscopy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431018-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016465-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7700321-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154818-8>
Synthesis and Characterization of Telechelic Poly(3-hexylthiophenes) ¤ conjugated polymers; organic solar cells; P3HT; end group functionalisation; HPLC-ESI-ToF MS; perylene derivatives The aim of the present dissertation was the synthesis of bivalente poly(3-hexylthiophene)s (P3HT) bearing hydrogen bonding moieties on the end groups. Molecular recognition can be set up between the end group of functionalized P3HT and 3,4:9,10-perylentetracarboxylic acid dimides (PTCDI) via supramolecular interactions. Different reagents has been tested for the functionalization of P3HT with spezific end groups and the products were analysed semiquantitatively using mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (HPLC-ESI-ToFMS). PTCDI-derivates with thymine, triazine and barbiturate end groups were synthesized and used as electron acceptor materials with complementary hydrogen bonding moities. The characterization of the PTCDI products was accomplished via elemental analysis, ESI-ToFMS and 1H-NMR spectroscopy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236284-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7617672-1>
Radiative corrections to the decay of the top quark ¤ The calculation of the NLO electroweak and QCD corrections to the top-quark decay width, including the W-boson decay and off-shell effects is presented. Both the semileptonic and the hadronic decays are considered. The one-cutoff slicing method has been extended to decay processes with more than two charged particles, to deal with soft and collinear divergences. Its generalization has been obtained using mass regularization. In order to check the validity of the method employed, the calculation has been compared against an independent one and against the values obtained using the narrow-width approximation. Furthermore, the total top-quark decay width has been calculated and compared with the existing experimental measurements END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185791-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067675-4>
Notstandsalgorithms : Dilemmas in Automated Road Traffic ¤ The digitisation of various areas of life holds new challenges for the law. In particular, automated driving has been the subject of intense and controversial discussions. Coping with dilemmas – which, thanks to a broad media coverage, have also attracted public attention - occupies a special position.This volume analyses extreme situations in which an evasive maneuver will inevitably affect other legally protected interests. A central question is whether these actions can be justified or excused.

Fracture Energy of Running Cracks in Rock ¤ Seismicity of the upper crust - a topic of great social relevance - is largely controlled by brittle fracture processes. To date, there is no closed description of the energetic conditions for these. Results from energy considerations in laboratory scale seem not to be transferable to in-situ conditions due to too low fracture energies. In the present work, novel methods for geomaterials are used to investigate whether part of this difference results from the fact that crack speeds in the laboratory - compared to natural earthquake events - are usually low. For the first time in rock, the energy dissipation at running cracks is determined up to the maximum fracture speed. In total, a significant increase in the energy level is obtained and valuable insights are gained for the energy balance of dissipative spreading processes in rocks ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112837-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020734-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136911-7>
Urban Alternatives - Housing Demand Groups of Younger Age in Erlangen ¤ Germany is getting older and through a renaissance of urban living forms, the demographic composition of urban residential areas is also changing. One is not old by a rigid age boundary based on a characteristic or a disciplinary definition. Rather, one becomes old through the change and decline of competences, performance and reserves connected with increasing morbidity as well as the change of previous social roles. In this context, reactions to changes vary individually. Despite the flowing individual aging processes and aging, it is necessary to define an investigation group, i.e. citizens who have completed their 60th year of life are counted among the elderly. However, it is still necessary to distinguish between the young elderly (60-80 years of life) and the old old (after 80 years of life). The basis for differentiation is the often healthier, more capable physical and mental condition as well as a more active lifestyle of the first group. Furthermore, the multimorbidity grade is relatively lower and the self-competence grade is higher. However, it is not possible to assume a homogeneous group with fixed age boundaries. The widespread, basic image of the single, lonely, immobile and poor person in old age is not correct. The greater part of daily or frequent activities takes place in the house, but a not insignificant part of the activities takes place outside in the living environment. This, however, affects the perception, evaluation and use for everyday life management positively or negatively depending on the characteristics, equipment and personal prerequisites...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001446-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079368-0>
Influencing pattern formation and localization through disorder ¤ Lattice-gas simulation; Liesegang pattern; fluctuations; disorder; metal-insulator-transition; Anderson-transition; small magnetic field; complex networks; scale-free network; clustering The goal of this dissertation is to understand how pattern formation and localization can be influenced by the introduction of disorder. Pattern formation is treated using lattice-gas simulations of Liesegang stripe formation. Thermal fluctuations and homogeneous or inhomogeneous nucleation properties of the medium form the disorder parameters. Interestingly, disorder enhances or initiates pattern formation. In addition, it has been shown that a continuous modification of the inhomogeneities of the substrate can be used to obtain equidistant distances of Liesegang stripes on small length scales. Localization is discussed in the context of the Anderson model. Disorder is introduced into the system as a small magnetic field or as topological structural disorder in the form of complex networks. It has been shown that a local topological property, namely clustering, causes a metal-insulator transition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137934-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204276-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226961-1>
Commutation Calculation for Permanent Magnet DC Commutator Motors of Small Power ¤ In the present work, a procedure for calculating commutation in permanent magnet DC commutator motors (PM-DC motors) is presented. Furthermore, the fundamentals of current usage and the factors influencing them are discussed. Within the scope of the work, a summary of the most important methods for measuring and evaluating commutation is also provided, as these investigations are still highly relevant for small machine development. The procedures are explained using concrete examples and evaluated in terms of effort and their validity, as well as used for the validation of the new calculation approach. The analysis of known calculation procedures on their suitability and limitations closes this topic. Using the newly developed simulation approach for a complete drive system, current usage can be analyzed in all operating states. The model description includes the influence of the magnetic circuit, control, drive mechanics, and brush-commutator contact system. The creation and parameterization of drive models is discussed, including specific characteristics of PM-DC motors of small power. A focus is on the behavior of the contact system and its representation with all essential influencing factors. Subsequently, practice-relevant questions on commutation behavior are analyzed using drive simulation. Based on the calculation results, aspects for the design and design of PM-DC motors can be derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123042-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031092-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138142-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272297-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164831-6>
The protection guaranteed by Article 8 ECHR against state interference in personal rights in the internet ¤ The book deals with the topic of the protection guaranteed by Article 8 ECHR against state interference in personal rights in the internet. It addresses the question of whether Article 8 ECHR can effectively protect the personal rights of the individual in the internet from state interference. It is to be taken into account that Article 8 ECHR, unlike Article 8 ECHR, does not contain an explicit reference to data protection. The work shows that Article 8 ECHR still guarantees an independent right to informational self-determination and that personal data are also covered by the scope of this guarantee. It goes into more detail on the interference with the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 ECHR. In this regard, particular attention is paid to the individual phases of data use. Finally, the justification grounds prescribed by Article 8 (2) ECHR are considered in the sense that special requirements arise for the justification of information-technical interventions in the internet.

Motives of the Initial Public Offering on the New Market: Public Financing of Innovations from a Theoretical and Empirical Perspective ¤ In the public, new issues are primarily discussed from a return perspective and thus from the investor's point of view. The question of the motives for the initial public offering is rarely asked, although a closer examination of the motive would also be of great importance for individual investment decisions. In the present work, it is particularly about the question of why innovative growth companies in particular choose public financing and against private placement of shares. -- Initially, the various possible motives for an initial public offering are examined from a theoretical perspective, taking into account the specifics of the innovation process. Subsequently, the theoretical considerations are subjected to an empirical examination in the framework of a comprehensive investigation of the new issuers on the New Market and in other German market segments. -- The discussion with the essential financing theoretical works shows that the advantages of an initial public offering ultimately depend on the broad share dispersion, the information aggregation in the secondary market prices, and the immediacy of the capital allocation relationship. -- The results of the empirical investigation show two mutually exclusive motives for an initial public offering as particularly significant: Obviously, the initial public offering fulfills partially different functions in innovative growth companies than in established companies. On the one hand, there are companies in which the previous controlling shareholders are looking for a way to finance pending investments externally, without having to accept a restriction on the power of disposal over the operational resources. Companies listed on the New Market are generally to be counted among this group. On the other hand, there are (mainly established) companies in which the previous controlling shareholders use the initial public offering as the first stage of a complete disposal of the shares.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219438-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557875-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419554-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078620-1>
Engagement and Remembrance: Left History in Post-1989 Novel Literature ¤ It is said that the winners write history. How, then, is the remembrance of the struggles of the workers' movement after 1989 told? Are stories of decline and a 'left melancholy' dominant, or does a thinking of possibilities unfold in the remembrance of the past, which is also able to re-perspective the future? Sebastian Schweer analyzes engaged German-language memory novels in which the history of the workers' and movement is archived, criticized, reflected, and further spun. Following the question of the relationship between novel form, remembrance, and the status of utopian thinking, he deals with subjects such as squatting, terrorism, the legacy of the GDR, or socialist cybernetics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316012-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1175898139> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138493-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152247-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7564318-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033229-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033888-5>

The Expansion of Public Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles: Perspectives on State Governance for Climate Protection and Mobility Assurance ¤ Die Umstellung des Individualverkehrs auf Batterieelektromobilität ist ein zentraler Baustein für die zum Klimaschutz notwendige Verkehrswende. Ohne ein flächendeckendes Netz öffentlich zugänglicher Ladestationen sind Elektroautos jedoch nicht attraktiv genug. Die mangelnde Verfügbarkeit preisgünstiger Lademöglichkeiten vor allem auf dem Land hemmt die Verbreitung der klimafreundlichen Antriebstechnologie. Es bedarf daher staatlicher Förderung, um den Ladeinfrastrukturausbau zu beschleunigen. Bei der Beurteilung verschiedener politischer Gestaltungsoptionen stellen sich regulierungsrechtliche Fragen. Im Zentrum steht dabei der rechtliche Rahmen für den Umgang mit dem Netzcharakter der Ladeinfrastruktur und ihren daraus folgenden ökonomischen Besonderheiten, insbesondere im Verhältnis von beschleunigtem Infrastrukturaufbau und Wettbewerbssicherung. Climate protection in private transport demands a switch to low-emission drive technologies. Electromobility looks particularly promising – but its success depends on a nationwide network of charging stations. With Germany still having some catching up to do, Charlotte Schings takes a legal look at the various options for state funding to speed up the rollout of charging facilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123869-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023745712> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1042006857> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
Growth and characterisation of lead iodide single crystals ¤ Abstract: This work deals with the growth and characterization of lead iodide single crystals. The semiconductor material lead iodide (PbI2) is suitable for application as a X-ray or gamma-ray detector at room temperature. It has decisive advantages over other materials such as HgI2, CdTe, Si, GaAs: due to a bandgap energy of 2.32 eV, excellent absorption capacity, and high specific resistance, PbI2 represents a promising alternative for the production of noise-free detectors that do not require additional cooling. However, a particular challenge in the application of PbI2 as a detector material is the growth and preparation of chemically and structurally high-quality single crystals. Against this background, the effectiveness of zone purification of the PbI2 used for growth was spectroscopically confirmed, as well as technological aspects during the further processing of purified PbI2 were investigated. Based on thermal analyses, a correlation between the degree of influence of atmospheric oxygen on the source material and the structural quality of the resulting crystals was found. The use of hydrogen gas as an effective method for removing oxidative impurities was transferred to PbI2 and led to a significant reduction in structural defects such as polycrystalline growth or stress cracks. The growth of PbI2 single crystals was carried out, inter alia, by the Bridgman-Stockbarger method, where the influences of ampule design and preparation were particularly investigated	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273153-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146604-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140616-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461684-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145915-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148717-5>

Titan-Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation ¤ Because of the great biological and industrial relevance of amines new pathways for an easy and convenient access to this substance class have been investigated over many years. The metal-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes is a 100% atom-efficient reaction of great interest. In this doctoral thesis it was shown for the first time that titanium-based catalysts can be used for efficient metal-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylations of terminal alkenes. Interestingly, Ti-complexes with very different structures like Ti(NMe2)4, TiBn4 or Ind2TiMe2 showed a high catalytic activity. Besides the hydroaminoalkylation, the hydroamination of alkenes is also an elegant and 100 % atom-efficient pathway to more complex amines. The results presented in this doctoral thesis prove that the Lewis-acids GaCl3 and GaBr3 show a promising catalytical activity for the hydroamination of alkenes with p-toluenesulfonamide. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038906-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217435-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160579-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2>
Process and Cost Analysis of Packaging Options for Sterile Supplies in German Hospitals ¤ Kostenanalyse, Hospital, Management, Process analysis, Simulation, Sterile supply, Scenario analysis, Time measurement study Sterile supply through reprocessing of medical devices is often outside the focus of hospital managers as a process remote from the patient, even though this area is both medically and economically essential to the quality of the treatment process. The use of different survey techniques, such as document analysis and time measurement, can contribute to a comprehensive overall view and thus support a decision. This paper investigates the different packaging options of sterile supplies in six hospitals in Germany. With the help of an extensive time measurement study, the time differences in both packaging-related processes and infrastructural processes are first clarified. Furthermore, all relevant cost items are determined, resulting in costs for each packaging option. A distribution adjustment is carried out for both the times and the costs and then a Monte Carlo simulation is performed on this basis. In order to test the stability of the results obtained, a detailed scenario analysis is carried out in which a wide variety of input parameters, such as personnel and material costs, but also handling frequencies, are changed to show under which circumstances the advantageousness of an individual packaging option is given. If, for example, a change in packaging options results in free personnel capacities, these can be used to expand the range of services both in-house and for third parties. The work shows that the choice of packaging option is not the only decisive factor, but ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063118-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131097-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205810-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136607-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032580-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032786-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9>
Operative Management of Production Enterprises: Development of a Process Model ¤ The management of production enterprises faces the problem that the derivation of strategic plans into operational action possibilities and their implementation often do not lead to the desired success. The goals developed from the strategy process often do not correspond to the action potentials; implementation weaknesses arise. Manfred Bracher focuses the operative management of production enterprises under the aspect of goal-oriented corporate management in the focus of his consideration. He critically questions existing management models and investigates how they can be applied to solve the problem statement. The author develops a process model that he illuminates within a multi-dimensional order system under the aspects of processes, structures, evaluation, and corporate culture. In this, the adaptation and integration of Total Productive Maintenance play a crucial role. He checks the applicability and effectiveness of the model using a case study and derives action recommendations for the management of production enterprises.

Noise in the Hospital Operating Room: Performance Enhancement and Error Prevention through Optimized Acoustics ¤ Optimal acoustic conditions and noise-reducing measures provide the basis for concentrated work and promote error prevention. For the operating surgeon, communication deficits and distraction can be concrete consequences of inadequate acoustics. Philipp Knöfler illustrates with measurements in the operating surgeon's ear canal that the recommended noise maximum level at the operating table is clearly exceeded. For the examined operating room, possibilities for reducing the level were developed, which can also be transferred to other operating rooms. However, to ensure an acoustic minimum standard in the realization of operating rooms, simple and manageable guidelines must be implemented in the planning process. The planning task 'quiet operating room' should urgently find its way into practice, so that the working conditions for the staff can be improved and an adequate environment can also be created for the patient.

Investigations of the Vibration and Noise Behavior of the Crankshaft Drive of an Internal Combustion Engine ¤ Body vibration paths in the internal combustion engine -- measurement of piston oscillations -- measurement value transmission system for real engine operation -- comparison of experimental results with simulation calculations. By combining various measurement technology concepts in the field of body vibration measurement and using detailed signal analysis methods, Daniel Hrdina can present a comprehensive understanding of body vibration transmission over the crankshaft drive of an internal combustion engine. In doing so, he investigates the sensitivity to various parameters in the internal transmission path and in the excitation conditions. As the most influential factor, the author identifies the pressure rise rate – and thus the injection parameters. Based on this, he introduces the concept of the operating point-dependent combustion chamber pressure gradient, which shows potential for optimization under NVH aspects at a passenger car diesel engine with common rail injection.

Methods of Data Mining Applied to the Flexibility Attributes of Automotive Body Construction for Strategic Investment Planning ¤ The concept of flexibility is always in vogue in the production world, especially in the automotive industry. Increasing derivatives and fluctuations on the sales markets enhance the demand for flexible production facilities.--- The primary problem statement associated with this is that the concept of flexibility is not clearly defined, and accordingly, there is a diffuse general understanding of flexibility. Furthermore, the factors that describe flexibility and the associated investments are mostly unknown. Specifically, for automotive body construction, this paradox was taken up in this work and flexibility was made measurable in the form of investments.--- After analyzing general variant and flexibility management, flexibility can be divided into four areas based on Kaluza's schema. These four areas or flexibility types have general validity and can always be used synonymously for other commonly used designations ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165423-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125037-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126392-3>

Bourgeois Chill : Affect and Colonial Subjectivity ¤ "Bourgeois Chill" refers to a present-day emotional state with which citizens shield themselves from the violence they themselves cause. With colonialism and the philosophy of the Enlightenment in view, Henrike Kohpeiss shows how racist emotional structures develop. For this, the classical, critical texts by Adorno and Horkheimer enter into a dialogue with the field of Black Studies and thinkers like Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, and Denise Ferreira da Silva. These two intellectual traditions are connected by radical criticism of the capitalist and colonial establishment of the world. The violence history of European colonialism is thus read as an affect theory of bourgeois subjectivity, its appearance of innocence is taken away	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055876-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112846-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4417983-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058323-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073624-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6>
Morphology and crystal orientation of ferroelectric P(VDF-ran-TrFE) nanostructures in porous aluminium oxide ¤ We have fabricated ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) nanostructures using ordered nanoporous aluminium oxide. The nanostructures were characterised using DSC, XRD, SEM and TEM. The DSC results show that the melting temperature decreases with increasing confinement, while the transition temperature from the ferro- to the paraelectric phase, TC, remains unchanged. We provide an explanation for the unchanged TC in confinement based on the thermodynamic stability of the different phases. The results of X-ray scattering show that the (110) planes of the crystallites in P(VDF-TrFE) preferentially orient parallel to the substrate surface, with the polar b-axis at an angle of 30° to the pore axis. Furthermore, our results show that the preferred orientation is established in two steps. In the first step - during crystallisation - the parallel orientation of the c-axis to the substrate surface is established. In the second step - during the transition to the ferroelectric phase - the (110) planes orient parallel to the substrate surface. This orientation of the (110) planes is a result of the minimisation of the depolarisation field in the nanostructures.

Rationality Deficits in the Actions of Controllers: Forms of Expression and Countermeasures ¤ If one understands controlling as a rationality safeguard of leadership, it has the function to identify and alleviate potential rationality deficits in the actions of managers due to self-interested behavior and cognitive limitations. Essential carriers of this function are controllers. Anne Paefgen examines the following question: Must not also for controllers the assumption apply to act self-interestedly and be cognitively limited? But who then secures the rationality of the controllers themselves or – formulated differently – who controls the controller? From a behavioral scientific perspective, the author analyzes potential rationality deficits in the actions of controllers and traces them back to their possible causes. From the insights gained in this way, she derives reactive and proactive measures to secure the rationality of controllers.

Design, realization, and characterization of optical negative index metamaterials ¤ This work deals with artificial nanostructured optical materials - metamaterials, which possess optical properties that do not occur in natural materials. The metamaterials consist of elementary cells, whose size is smaller than the wavelength of light and can therefore be considered as effective media. The effective optical parameters of the metamaterials are, in analogy to natural materials, determined by the electromagnetic properties of the elementary cells or "meta-atoms" and can be changed by adapted design. The goal of this work was to formulate design principles for metamaterials with a negative refractive index in the optical spectral range and to develop experimental methods for the characterization of their optical properties. The design strategies for double-element metamaterials were developed based on the evaluation of the production method based on electron beam lithography. As a result, a metamaterial in the near-infrared spectral range with a negative refractive index was successfully realized. The possibility of optimizing the optical properties of the metamaterials by breaking the symmetry of the meta-atom geometry was investigated analytically using a multipole model and experimentally. It was shown that asymmetry has a significant impact on the magnetic properties of the meta-atoms and allows the control of the effective magnetic permeability of metamaterials in wide ranges. For the complete and precise determination of the refractive index of metamaterials, an experimental method was developed, which is based on the interferometric determination of the transfer function of an optical metamaterial. For this purpose, a setup for phase measurements in transmission and reflection in the visible and near-infrared spectral range was developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547278-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123887-4>
Key Actors in Nuclear Waste Governance: Disposal Options and Strategies from a Regional Perspective ¤ Social scientific ‚nuclear waste research‘ -- Individual expectations of waste disposal policy (after 2014) -- Fair and effective citizen participation at potential sites -- Individual evaluation of disposal options. Cord Drögemüller deals with the regional dimension of the nuclear waste conflict in the Federal Republic of Germany. From the perspective of governance and participation research, he examines local problem perceptions. In this context, he shows the expectations of municipal politicians and civil society interest groups for a ‚good‘ waste disposal policy. The author highlights the opportunities and limitations of citizen participation as well as the evaluation of different disposal options. He shows that a reliable and flexible nuclear waste governance is needed, which enables high-quality and demand-oriented participation of citizens with fair negotiation processes. Classical control approaches fall short of meeting the demanding civil society expectations.

The History of Email: Success and Crisis of a Mass Medium ¤ Millions of emails go around the world every day. The more astonishing it is that the origin of this medium seems to have happened almost by the way and has been hardly worked on scientifically so far. This study reconstructs the success story of the email service and shows that technology can only be successful as a network of technical, social, and cultural relationships. If this framework changes without the technology reacting to it, it falls into a fatal crisis, whose effects we are trying to combat today in the form of spam and phishing attacks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078176-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191427-2>

Distribution Approximation by Convex Bounds : with Applications to Sums of Lognormally Distributed Random Variables ¤ The goal of the present work was to explore and investigate possibilities for approximating the terminal value of investment plans, as typically offered by banks and insurance companies. Of interest are approximations for the distribution function, quantiles, truncated expectations, and tail values at risk. The modeling of the underlying stock price processes is, as usual, as geometric Brownian motion, so that the terminal value of a stock portfolio plan is structurally a sum of lognormally distributed random variables. The distribution of such a sum is, however, not explicitly given; its simulation is naturally possible, but due to the multitude of investment plans to be managed by a bank or insurance company, impractical. Again and again, one comes across works that point out that the sum of lognormally distributed random variables can be well approximated by a one-dimensional lognormally distributed random variable, usually by one with the same expectation and the same variance. This could mostly be supported only by simulations and numerical calculations. We present here a result that provides a justification for the mentioned approximation: the distribution convergence to a lognormal distribution at vanishing variances/covariances of the summands ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183371-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124458-8>
When Voters Decide: Processes of Decision-Making and the Timing of the Election Decision ¤ This volume deals with the measurement and theoretical interpretation of the timing of the election decision. To this end, a theory of the decision-making process is developed, which produces a synthesis of hitherto disparate research results. Two results are to be highlighted: Firstly, no clear increase in later election decisions can be demonstrated. Secondly, it can be shown that the timing of the election decision results from a complex interplay of voter characteristics, characteristics of the decision situation, and the information environment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079009-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064144-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4325993-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121202-2>
Sequential Investment Decisions under Uncertainty ¤ Real investments are associated with a wide range of different decisions. These decisions are highly interdependent. The initial investment decision must take into account the possibility of being able to make subsequent decisions. This fact becomes particularly relevant when income from investment projects is expected to be received in the distant future, i.e., when there is a long time span between the initial investment decision and the sale of products. In this case, uncertainty about prices, demand, or the behavior of competitors and the possibility of reacting to it play an important role. The author deals with the sequential character of investment decisions under uncertainty. For this purpose, models are developed that are based on options price and game-theoretic findings and can thus include both uncertainty about prices and demand as well as the behavior of competitors in the analysis. From these models, numerous findings can be derived that are of significant importance for the further development of investment theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162244-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128461-6>
Optical Method for Two-Dimensional Measurement of Angles and Angle Changes at Large Measurement Distances ¤ In the present dissertation, a new measurement method and a new measuring device for two-dimensional measurement of angles and angle changes are presented based on a specific task from industrial production. Conventional methods already in use as well as alternative methods based on further physical principles are used and evaluated. A solution based on a so-called vignetting field-blade method is described in its principal structure and function and its suitability is investigated in relation to the task. The theoretical foundations are initially presented in a purely geometric-optical manner and are further subjected to a lighting-technical consideration with natural vignetting. The illumination intensity distribution of the light spot in the image plane, the so-called V-SPOT, is analytically derived in dependence on various influencing factors. Furthermore, intensity and centroid shifts within the V-SPOT are investigated by effects such as geometric-optical influences, radiation characteristics of the object illumination area in dependence on the radiation angle as well as luminance distribution in dependence on the location in the object plane by numerical simulation. Based on these foundations, the theoretical investigations of the possible measurement range, linearity, and physical resolution limit are carried out. The theoretical investigations are compared with experimentally determined measurements and deviations are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172667-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131446-3>

Interaction of amino acids with different ionogenic groups ¤ The subject of this work is the investigation of amorphous silica and mesoporous silicate MCM-41. The focus was on determining the influence of the structure of the silica as a starting material on the properties of the produced material, on the synthesis and on the efficiency of the product in catalytic and adsorption applications. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goal, the modification of amorphous silica and MCM-41 was carried out. For this, the silylation method was chosen. Another important goal of the present work was the investigation of the adsorption of amino acids from aqueous solutions on the starting materials and modified silicates, in order to determine the influence of the structure of the starting material, as well as the built-in functional layer on the adsorption of biologically active molecules. The type of interactions that occur in the system „adsorbate - silicate adsorbent“ were analyzed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163765-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4608084-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142205-3>
Synthesis of Dihydropyridine Derivatives for Biological Profiling ¤ In the first part of this work, important details of the mechanism of synthesis of crossed dihydropyridines (DHP) were clarified. By breaking down the 4-component reaction into sub-reactions, potential key intermediates were isolated and characterized, as well as implausible reaction pathways were excluded. By inserting the hypothetical intermediate into the crossed DHP synthesis and following the reaction course by in situ NMR, the preferred reaction pathway was identified. To optimize the yield of the crossed DHP synthesis, the influence of reaction parameters pH value, temperature, and solvent as well as Lewis acidic catalysts such as Yb(OTf)3 was investigated. The best results were achieved by the conversion in methanol at 120 °C in the microwave oven over 10 min, the crossed DHP with yields of 60-90% was obtained. In the second part of the work, it was investigated to what extent the inhibitory effect on the Notch signaling pathway depends on the structure of the DHP. Derivatives of the DHP FLI-06 were synthesized, either by substituting the reaction components or by converting the DHP in subsequent reactions. The modifications with the highest biological activity were combined to increase possible interactions with a hypothetical binding pocket. In total, 143 DHP were synthesized and investigated for their biological activity in this work. By separating the enantiomers of the three most active DHP using chiral HPLC, enantioselectivity of the biological activity was demonstrated. An enantioselective synthesis, however, was not successful, corresponding literature reports were not reproducible. The presented DHP served as a 'tool compound' to identify potential intermolecular interactions with a hypothetical binding pocket, which were summarized in a pharmacophore. Based on the findings of the structure-activity relationship, first molecular probes were developed to investigate the localization of DHP in the cell. Several DHP with functionalized side chains were synthesized. They enable coupling with other compounds by click reaction, amidation, and through the presentation of thioethers. Methods for enantiomer separation using chiral HPLC were also developed to be able to distinguish selective colocalization of background signals. It was possible to observe first colocalizations in mitochondria. Their connection with the specific efficacy of DHP must still be further investigated. This work provides a basis for the development of molecular probes that can contribute to the clarification of the role of the target of DHP in the Notch signaling pathway in healthy as well as in diseased cells.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113318-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064937-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4762370-6>
Investigation of the applicability of wetland biomass for producing hydrochar by hydrothermal carbonization and its effectiveness for the adsorption of ammonia ¤ The underlying motivation of this work was the use of widespread but underutilized wetland biomass as reed, typha, juncus and carex to be used as substrates for the hydrothermal carbonation (HTC) to produce a variety of high-value carbonaceous materials and to test their suitability as alternative adsorbents for the removal of ammonia in aqueous solution. The results of this work confirmed that it was possible to transform these wetland biomasses into carbonaceous products with a sufficiently high efficiency for ammonia removal in aqueous solution, which could be designed as a filter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001735-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040195-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1190840804> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141454-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006877-8>

Passages of Pedagogy: Towards a Pedagogical Moment in the Wake of Niklas Luhmann and Gilles Deleuze ¤ This study raises the question of how pedagogy can be thought of as mobile and systematic beyond the petrification in systemic structures. This paradoxical starting constellation can be met with Luhmann's late systems theory, which attempts to push a differentialist turn beyond the classical concept of difference. The hitherto open ends of this project are further developed with Deleuze. In a topological reading - especially from the perspective of a topology of difference - pedagogy can be refigured as an expression system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044302-4>
Interorganizational Information Systems in the Maritime Supply Chain: An Information Economic Investigation in the Field of Containerized Inland Transport ¤ Holger Pontow demonstrates that interorganizational information systems in the fragmented maritime supply chain hold numerous potential benefits. To be able to evaluate these qualitatively and quantitatively in advance of investment decisions, he uses methods and tools from the fields of business process management (especially business process modeling using BPMN) and decision theory in the core of his investigation. It shows – especially on the basis of the mediated cross-organizational business process understanding – that, in addition to organizations that realize the transport and handling, especially shippers should use suitable systems for communication in order to realize the theoretically possible potential benefits in practice.

Virtualization of Embedded Real-Time Systems in Multi-Core Operation for Partitioning Safety-Relevant Vehicle Software ¤ The automotive industry has seen a significant increase in new electrical and electronic vehicle functions over the past few years. This leads to an increase in software volumes in embedded systems. Non-functional requirements such as safety, performance, reliability, and maintainability pose additional challenges for the development of future vehicle systems. To reduce the number of control units, vehicle functions are to be consolidated on common integration control units. System virtualization can be a targeted approach to facilitate software migration to integration control units and meet the required isolation requirements of new security standards at the same time. In this work, the partitioning of safety-relevant vehicle functions on a common hardware platform is focused. Using methods for evaluating social networks, a graph-based approach is presented to assess the partitionability of software networks with safety-relevant components. For the realization of system partitioning, a method for selecting the most suitable kernel architecture is introduced. From selected non-functional properties, potential technical solution concepts are derived within a tree structure and evaluated in an engineering manner. Based on this, a hypervisor for embedded real-time systems of ETAS Ltd. is evaluated. To be able to assess the costs of an additional hypervisor layer, runtime measurements are performed in this framework. Thus, the effects of an additional virtualization layer on vehicle software systems to fulfill selected non-functional properties are shown. The connection of virtualized systems to the communication interfaces of the hypervisor is another focus. Virtual control units continue to exchange information over already implemented communication channels and access common hardware resources. Thus, a concept is introduced to decouple safety-relevant parts of the AUTOSAR Microcontroller Abstraction Layers. The hypervisor itself is extended at relevant points and a reliable communication concept is implemented. A demonstrator setup, to consolidate productive vehicle software on a common hardware platform, finalizes the work. Here, independent software states are paravirtualized. As a summary of the work, the reader receives both a technical overview of the added value and the costs of paravirtualized vehicle platforms, which are integrated on small control units.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077423-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191569-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137282-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4767762-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4674460-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131397-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4760707-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4839180-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4542600-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/103238512X>
Modelling and use of SysML behaviour models for achieving dynamic use cases of technical products in different VR-systems ¤ Digital methods and models enable product designers to evaluate the product early on, so that they can better understand the product's behavior and its interactions with neighboring systems in its later life phases. Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that can contribute to the early evaluation process by displaying later life situations of a product already in the design phase. However, the application of VR in industry is currently limited due to the high model preparation effort and the limited reusability of existing models. Therefore, this work deals with the development of a method that can facilitate early product evaluation within VR and the use of VR in the product development process. This method deals with the process of developing general behavior descriptions for use in VR, which can also be reused to depict dynamic use cases of a product in different VR systems. The focus is on reducing the entire model preparation effort for VR models and on achieving a high reusability of existing models. The core components of the work consist in the use of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to develop general behavior model descriptions, their use in creating different use cases of a product in a VR system, and their reuse in different VR systems. The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is used to describe the behavior models, the modeling process is systematically described and also summarized in the form of general application guidelines for later use. In addition, a dedicated physics engine is used to perform the physical calculations for virtual objects in VR, which is also integrated with SysML. These SysML behavior models together with the physics engine form a real-time product application simulation in VR. The same SysML behavior models are used for different VR systems to depict real-time simulations and to validate their reuse. Two VR prototypes were developed to demonstrate the effectiveness and use of the presented methods. Finally, one of the prototypes was subjected to an empirical study conducted by experts from science and industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1147892059> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4399931-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7537632-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139402-1>
Abstract Period Spaces, Projectors, and Traces of Hecke Operators ¤ The subject of the dissertation is the purely algebraic construction of a projector onto abstract period spaces. The abstract period spaces can be viewed as a generalization of the period spaces from the context of classical elliptic modular forms (Manin relations). With the help of the projector, an abstract trace formula of the Hecke operators is then derived, and as an application of this, Zagier's trace formula at level 1 (1990) is reconstructed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018935-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002919-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4499626-3>
The Neighbourhood Space under Article 8 TEU: Status Quo and Potential of European Neighbourhood Relations ¤ How does the European Union do justice to the special proximity relationship with its neighbouring states? This work approaches the topic of European neighbourhood relations with a normative approach. It analyses what potential Article 8 TEU holds for neighbourhood relations. The look at Article 8 TEU largely dissociates itself from the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and thus opens up a new access to the political concept of European neighbourhood relations. The norm analysis shows a neighbourhood space that stands out in the system of European external relations particularly through its privilege effect and its independence. In relation to the Association Agreement with Ukraine, the ENP is set in relation to the neighbourhood space as the status quo of European neighbourhood relations. This juxtaposition reveals that the status quo does not exploit the potential of Article 8 TEU.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4470226-7>

Regions of Education in Scientific Further Education: Model and Empirical Analysis ¤ In the dissertation, a cross-disciplinary concept of education regions is developed: theoretically and empirically founded. The study on demand-oriented regionalization approaches in scientific further education is based on empirical data and case studies. In the results of the analysis, a new regionalization is confirmed as a counter-movement to internationalization, which is consciously designed in scientific further education. This is also part of economic regional development, as the qualification offers are further developed for the local skilled workers. The author presents the first investigation on this relevant topic of education and higher education practice. His practice-oriented analysis underpins the regionalization trends of scientific higher education further development with a theoretical foundation and creates a model as an orientation for practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015428-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177425-5>

The spectra of indefinite singular Sturm-Liouville operators ¤ In the present work, the spectral properties of singular Sturm-Liouville differential operators of the form Af=1/r(-(pf')' + qf) with real-valued coefficients p, q, and r are investigated. Here, we consider indefinite weight functions r. Based on knowledge from relative oscillation theory as well as Floquet theory for periodic Sturm-Liouville operators, criteria are established that ensure the stability of the essential spectra under perturbation of the coefficients. Furthermore, the accumulation of eigenvalues in the gaps of the essential spectrum is investigated. We formulate conditions that imply the accumulation of eigenvalues within a gap, or exclude it. Additionally, the non-real spectra of indefinite Sturm-Liouville operators are investigated. Here, bounds of the non-real eigenvalues with respect to their absolute value and imaginary part are determined. The proof of the bounds relies on a careful analysis of the associated eigenfunctions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128474-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335827-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128420-3>
Crystallization of a UV-structurable Glass in the System Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ¤ UV-structurable glasses expand the material palette of materials used in microsystem technology. Micro-mechanical components, such as grippers, sensors, and micro-drives with high aspect ratios in the micrometer range can be manufactured through the process of photostructuring of glass. In this work, the process flows for the crystallization of a UV-structurable glass in the system Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 are investigated. The relationships found in this process expand the existing scientific understanding of the complex physical and chemical processes that occur in this specific glass. In accordance with the requirement to set the redox system necessary for UV structuring in the starting glass, the first part of the work briefly addresses the successful production of the glass melted in a small-scale plant. The main part of this work deals with the solution of still open questions about the mechanism of heterogeneous, UV radiation-supported formation of crystal nuclei. Using various experimental methods, the processes during the technological individual steps of illumination, tempering, and etching were investigated. It was largely possible to clarify the effect of silver as a nucleus former and to define the exact illumination and thermal conditions for nucleus formation and crystal growth. In contrast to previously assumed findings, the silver ions are not only located in the droplet-like inhomogeneities of the glass, but are finely dispersed both in the matrix and in the droplets. Only in the droplets can the crystal phase lithium metasilicate grow on the silver clusters formed in the structuring process, since only here the chemical composition is suitable. The conditions found for the production of micro-structured components for nucleus formation and crystal growth are used as a prerequisite for the production of well-etchable crystal aggregates. By applying a multi-stage temperature regime with holding times at nucleus formation and crystal growth temperatures, industrially usable forceps were produced with high reproducibility and yield. Furthermore, the relationships found between illumination energy density, nucleus formation, and crystal growth conditions can be used to deliberately change the mechanical properties of photo-structured glass components. Defined illumination and special thermal post-treatment increased the bending strength of micro-structured components from about 340 to about 540 MPa.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4476622-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4372981-2>
Acting, Thinking, and Understanding : Investigations into the Natural-Scientific-Technical Subject Matter in Elementary School ¤ The starting point of Kornelia Möller's investigation is the controversial discussion among didacticians about the ability of elementary school children to productively deal with matters from nature and technology. The present work is based on multi-year, audiovisually recorded investigations in teaching-like, problem-oriented situations, which are documented and interpreted in this volume. In the interpretation, the previously neglected non-verbal media of confrontation, such as action, gesture, mimicry, and drawing, and their networking in their significance for thinking and interaction processes were analyzed. The author succeeds in proving that elementary school children give up their naive and pre-causal theories in favor of justified, verified, understandable, and communicable statements in a highly action-oriented learning process. This book offers rich material for designing productive, understanding-oriented learning processes in the natural-scientific-technical subject matter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051158-3>
An element-selective detector for gas chromatography based on a miniaturized capacitively stabilized plasma ¤ The subject of this work is a new atomic emission detector (AED) for gas chromatography (GC), the æ-ESD. In the present work, the design and operating principle of the æ-ESD are presented. The suitability of the detector for element-selective determination of Cl, Br, F, S, and C in the near infrared after optimization of some operating parameters was investigated. Furthermore, possibilities for correcting spectral and chemical interferences were discussed. The characterization of the detector was carried out on the basis of important detector properties such as selectivity and sensitivity. A final comparison of the æ-ESD with a commercial AED and an electron trap detector based on investigations of some environmental samples made it possible to assess the performance capability of the new detector. In direct comparison with the commercial AED, both analytical and economic aspects were considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046265-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019330-5>
Efficient and accurate evaluation of aggregation integrals in population balance equations ¤ Applications of population balance equations can be found in many chemical production processes, e.g, crystallization and precipitation of pharmaceutical materials. In population balance equations the aggregation process is described by source and sink aggregation integrals. The source aggregation integral is usually numerically expensive to evaluate having quadratic complexity. In this thesis we focus on the efficient and accurate evaluation of aggregation integrals, reducing this complexity to almost linear. We also include extensive numerical tests for different setups, leading to (heuristic) strategies for the choice of the discretization parameters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000728-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059317-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128986-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237200-8>
Education Coaching through Competence Monitoring and Adaptive E-Learning Support: A Case Study of Mathematics Basic Qualification at Universities ¤ Within the scope of this work, a comprehensive system was developed, operated, and evaluated, with which the mathematics entrance skills of students before the start of the first lectures are to be improved and homogenized. The global goal of this work was to develop and verify a transferable concept that enables the prevention of performance problems and reduces the dropout rate. The overall concept follows the approach that a high learning success can be achieved through a precise adjustment of the support measures to the individual mathematics competences of the students. For this purpose, the mathematics competences of the students were recorded in a database, which was used for individual adaptation of the presence and e-learning courses. The approach was divided into a conceptual and implementation phase, which was completed with the system development, and two practice phases with subsequent evaluation. The system was used university-wide for pre-qualification of all students. The formative evaluation of the system showed a high individual fit of the requirements in the pre-courses and a positive assessment of the adaptive measures on personal learning success. The summative evaluation showed a large learning gain of the students through the use of the system. In a t-test of dependent samples, a strong effect (d=1.83) was demonstrated. The average score achieved in the mathematics final test has more than doubled compared to the mathematics entrance test (entrance test: M=13.70; SD=8.82; n=132, final test: M=28.48; SD=7.31; n=132) and the performance differences between the students have leveled out. Thus, the current work provides a valuable knowledge gain for research, development, and practical implementation of qualification measures in the form of integrated blended learning systems in the study entrance phase, which, in the context of the inhomogeneity of the mathematics entrance competences of the students, achieve a high learning success through individual adaptation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125753-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148114-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183829-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167306-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074168-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183828-2>

The Budget Act as a Time Act: On the Significance of Temporal Bonds for Budget and Public Debt Law ¤ The Budget Act is a Time Act. It must be adopted at a specific point in time and is related to and limited to a specific period. Annuality and pre-budgeting of the budget are classical budget principles that have been brought back into focus by current constitutional court decisions on the limits of public debt. Henning Tappe analyzes central questions of budget law. What are the legal consequences of retroactive budget acts and credit authorizations? Can supplementary budgets also be adopted after the end of the budget year and approve the budget execution? What impact does the separation by years required by the Basic Law have on the assignment of revenues and expenditures to a specific budget plan?

GIS Concept and Contours of an IT Master Plan: Planning and System Development for Information Technology ¤ Geographic Information System (GIS) as an information medium -- Purpose of GIS use and current state -- Core problems and contours of strategic GIS planning -- Implication -- Summary -- Conclusion and Outlook. The development of information technology has experienced continuous diverse application euphoria since the end of the 1990s. This is based on a redundant, superficially integrated, and not systematically conceived IT landscape. In order to secure their competitiveness, administration, industry, and economy are today more than ever dependent on IuK technologies. However, the need to invest in IT infrastructure is often countered by statements from analysts that the majority of IT investments hardly achieve the originally set goals. Ghader Haghwerdi-Poor examines the purpose and goal of high investments in the IT sector within the framework of a ten-year balance analysis. Based on methods of action research, he describes the current state of the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) exemplarily. He analyzes the problems and creates the foundation stones of a master plan for the development, implementation, and use of this technology. It can be used not only for the completion of routine tasks of the administration, but also as an instrument of decision-making in cross-sectional tasks through data and information processing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047441-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261642-6>
New Approaches to Preparation and Quantitative Electrochemical Characterization of Catalyst Libraries for Oxygen Reduction ¤ This thesis deals with the combinatorial characterization of catalyst libraries for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution. The catalyst were printed and characterized as libraries onto glassy carbon and Ti. Different modes of the scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were used. Oxide catalysts were printed onto Ti and investigated with different SECM modes in 3D and 4D setups. A library with a gradient composition was characterized successfully with different 3D modes. Furthermore, this thesis describes the characterization of the activity of gas diffusion electrodes for the ORR using the redox competition mode in combination with a shear force control. Therefore, systems with the same compositions but different overall activities were investigated and compared. Furthermore, the relation between the activity and homogeneity of the catalyst layer was shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051803-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277879-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4432308-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4513555-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233024-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4535441-8>
Computational and Experimental Investigations of Sound Radiation at Vehicle Drives ¤ The present work aims to contribute to the improvement of the acoustic simulation of vehicle drives. Initially, the operating noise of a gearbox is simulated at constant rotational speeds. A method for decoupling the computationally intensive from the rotational speed-dependent part of the simulation is shown. Furthermore, the calculated sounds are auralized at a PC workstation. The results are to be understood as a preliminary study, but the synthetic operating noise sounds authentic. The modeling of component connections significantly influences the results of the body sound calculation within the acoustic simulation. FE models with screw connections and bearings are therefore systematically verified by measurements in a step-by-step and separate manner. After classifying simulation models for screw connections, model variants are derived and implemented at three different gearbox groups with flange connections. The results of the computational modal analysis are extensively compared with measurements in a broad frequency range. Since they exhibit almost single-component quality, a modeling recommendation can be given. For similar groups, the expected result quality and the importance of screw connections are now a priori assessable. The compliance behavior of bearings is described by linearized stiffness matrices. The FE models of two groups are verified at relevant eigenfrequencies with measurements at gearboxes with stationary waves. Uncertainties in bearing modeling and important influences are thus assessable. In total, the investigations on body sound simulation provide a decision-making aid for component connection modeling. At three gearbox housings with differently complex radiation surfaces, extensive investigations of air sound simulation with DBEM, IBEM, Fast-Multipole BEM, and FEM are carried out in a broad frequency range based on body and air sound measurements. By means of measurement-optimized input data, the deviations of the air sound simulation from the measurement are separated. It shows that sound fields can be precisely pre-calculated with various methods. Other aspects for the selection of the simulation method are also extensively discussed, for example, the computing times. The accuracy of the air sound simulation can be represented depending on the complexity of the radiating surfaces. The results of a ribbed gearbox are evaluated for acoustic models with and without ribs, so that the influence of the neglect of these geometric details is recognizable. Furthermore, various possibilities for preventing fictitious resonances in BEM are evaluated. In total, the present work expands the possibilities of acoustic simulation in several areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016320-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153580-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059219-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123687-7>
Modelling impacts of climate change on water resources in the Volta Basin, West Africa ¤ The Volta Basin is one of the largest river systems in Africa and covers an area of approximately 400,000 km2 with six West African bordering countries. The semi-arid to sub-humid regions of the Volta catchment belong to the climate-sensitive areas of Africa. The population is largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture and is therefore strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and its change due to climate change. Although the average water availability per capita in the catchment area does not indicate a high water stress, there is a large gradient between southern Ghana and northern Burkina Faso. It is to be expected that deforestation, land degradation, and high population growth combined with global climate change will lead to a decrease in available water resources, so that the water demand of the increasing population cannot be met. In the past, there were long droughts in the catchment area, in which rivers and streams dried up, as well as extreme floods in recent years due to very heavy rainfall. It is to be expected that these extremes will intensify...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285374-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151469-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124439-4>
Strategic Risk Management for Distribution Network Operators in the Liberalized Energy Market: Theory and Practical Implications ¤ The hard competition conditions in the liberalized electricity/gas market lead to insolvencies of energy suppliers (providers), which cause high financial damages to numerous creditors. A great concern is shown by the distribution network operators, whose supplier relationship is based on special energy economic conditions and existing business management approaches to risk-conscious design of the supplier relationship cannot be easily transferred. Kerstin Eiselbrecher develops a strategic risk management model that provides distribution network operators with a practical risk management process with action recommendations for early recognition/evaluation, handling, and monitoring of supplier risk from insolvencies and claims, taking into account the energy economic framework conditions and specifically selected risk factors. Through their central position in the supply chain of energy supply, their actions can also counteract the risk of further market partners connected with the suppliers. Dr. Kerstin Eiselbrecher completed her part-time doctorate under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Iris Hausladen at the Heinz Nixdorf Chair for IT-based Logistics at the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management. She has extensive professional experience in the energy supply sector and has presented at conferences on the claims management of distribution network operators. Already during her studies at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, she focused on energy economic questions. Her scientific focus is on the combination of energy economic and business management elements as well as the connection of theory and practice. Introduction -- Theoretical framework -- Metamodel for strategic risk management for distribution network operators -- Empirical investigation in the practice of distribution network operators -- Model of strategic risk management for application in practice -- Summary of results and outlook.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014712-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279392-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171506-8>
Aspect-Oriented Data Management in Product Configurators: Requirements, Concepts, and Realization ¤ Since the mid-20th century, the global socio-cultural process of individualization has also expressed itself in changed consumer behavior. In this context, companies are increasingly confronted with the desire for customer-specific products at the price of a mass product equivalent. While production-specific concepts such as modularization and the kit-of-parts principle can achieve an enormous variety of variants, product configurators as supporting IT application systems are necessary to control the complexity associated with this. These are introduced and classified in the first part of this work. Due to the mostly web-based use of product configurators, they must also meet the requirements of globalization. Regional differences regarding language or pricing policy not only affect the user interface but also have an impact on the structure and storage of products. To ensure data independence, a generic and orthogonal integration of those functional aspects referred to as dimensions is also desirable. For this purpose, the paradigm of aspect-oriented data management is formulated in the second part and possibilities for persistence are analyzed. In the third part, a general reference model for aspect-oriented data management is designed on the basis of the relational data model due to its high practical relevance for database systems. In addition, the comparison of suitable access techniques for evaluating the structures in the reference model also takes place. Finally, the practicability of the defined model is demonstrated. For this purpose, a prototypical implementation of the access layer, which is designed as an application library, is first described. Its evaluation by a comprehensive performance test ultimately confirms an efficient runtime behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4724728-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841318-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238909-4>
Swings in Concrete : the Shell Buildings of Ulrich Müther ¤ The engineer Ulrich Müther (1934-2007) created elegantly curved concrete shell constructions, which in the building industry of the GDR represented outstanding exception projects. He set effective counterpoints to the often monotonous large projects of that era. After Müther's buildings had largely fallen into oblivion in the meantime, a re-evaluation of his work has been taking place since the demolition of the Berlin "Ahornblatt" in 2000. In the meantime, the "Landbaumeister of Rügen" is internationally regarded as one of the most important concrete builders of his time. Tanja Seeböck illuminates Müther's position in the historical and international development of concrete shell construction, bridges the present by tracing the different fates of selected buildings and presents the first scientific work catalog. Based on interviews with Müther and numerous witnesses, as well as previously unpublished archival materials, the author analyzes the factors that made Müther a phenomenon among the builders of the GDR and asks why his "bold solitary figures" in the GDR, whose building industry was generally oriented towards maximum standardization, enjoyed such high esteem.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296279-1>
Continuous assessment of software traceability ¤ Traceability of requirements is an important quality feature of software development. For a variety of software development activities, traceability of requirements is a necessary prerequisite. This includes, among other things, the analysis of functional safety, influence analysis, coverage analysis or compliance. For the development of safety-critical software systems, this quality feature is of particular importance. Therefore, this is explicitly prescribed by corresponding guidelines for the development of safety-critical software. Although the relevance of traceability in software projects is generally known, only in a few cases is a systematic planning for achieving this quality feature applied. Often, traceability is implemented only afterwards. As a result, incomplete implementations of traceability often result, which are still used as a basis for major decisions. For this reason, the corresponding implementations should be subjected to a thorough examination, especially in the context of developing safety-critical systems. However, a variety of challenges must be overcome. On the one hand, traceability depends on project-specific goals. In safety-critical systems, often specifications from guidelines must be met. The use of traceability is also very strongly dependent on the respective goals. In this work, an approach to systematic testing of software projects with regard to their traceability of requirements is proposed. A necessary prerequisite for the testing approach is the precise planning and definition of traceability of requirements in a software project. Therefore, a corresponding planning approach is presented in the context of this work. Furthermore, an analytical model for systematic testing of traceability in software projects is presented. This model includes a complete classification of possible error types. In addition, criteria for systematic detection of these errors are proposed. The results of an expert survey confirm the completeness of the analytical test model. Moreover, the proposed approach to systematic testing of traceability of requirements was evaluated in two studies. In this way, the benefit of the approach for the development of safety-critical and non-safety-critical software could be proven.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480091-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1022831690> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213997-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121677-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116521-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126945-7>
Variable Compensation in Institutions as Part of Risk Management ¤ The legal processing of the international financial crisis that broke out in 2008 is not yet completed, ten years after the outbreak of the crisis. Part of the legislative measures addressing risk management is the regulation of compensation in banks through national provisions based on CRD IV (§ 25a KWG, InstitutsVergV n.F.). The work examines, on the one hand, whether the regulatory intensity that arose in the background of the initially discussed risk management function of variable compensation is justified. On the other hand, the application and practical implementation of the provisions in compensation agreements are in focus. The supervisory provisions pursue goals that are in conflict with labor law protection mechanisms, so that their compatibility raises relevant questions for practice. The author provides lawyers with suggestions for practical contract design. In addition, he addresses the legislator with suggestions for legislative further development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062855-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004473-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7573652-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418272-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035263-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002802-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4535644-0>
Experimental and Theoretical Investigations on the Extension of the Group Contribution Methods UNIFAC and Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) ¤ This thesis deals with the investigation of the group contribution methods UNIFAC and Modified UNIFAC (Dortund). These models allow to predict phase equilibria and excess properties, even if no experimental information of the examined system is given. For the fitting of UNIFAC group interaction parameters experimental data are necessary. Because experimental mixture data of some substance classes are missing systematic measurements have been carried out in order to extend the data base for phase equilibria. Therefore solid-liquid equilibria using the visual technique, azeotropic points using a wire band column, activity coefficients at infinite dilution using the gas-liquid chromatography and vapor-liquid equilibria using a new computer driven, dynamic apparatus have been measured. These mixture data have been used for the revision and extension of the UNIFAC and Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) models besides the Dortmund Data Bank.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132145-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043816-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426503-7>
Development of Biocompatible Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles for In Vivo Diagnostics, Especially in Magnetic Particle Imaging ¤ Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been successfully used as MRI contrast agents in clinical imaging for a considerable amount of time. By optimizing the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles, the diagnostic value of MRI applications can be further increased and the reliability of MR images improved. In addition to improving existing procedures, diagnostic imaging is also driven forward by the development of new procedures, such as Magnetic Particle Imaging. Since the measurement signal is generated by the magnetic nanoparticles themselves, MPI offers a significant advantage in terms of sensitivity while maintaining high temporal and spatial resolution. However, there is currently no commercially available in vivo-compatible MPI tracer, resulting in a pressing need for suitable innovative tracer materials. This motivated the development of biocompatible and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for use as in vivo diagnostics, especially in….	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047006-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185795-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221531-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023179504> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4468562-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2>

Sugar-modified guanosine analogs as versatile tools for shaping G-quadruplex architectures ¤ Magnetic Resonance, Nucleic Acids, Structure, guanosine analogs, hydrogen bond, quadruplex, sugar pucker G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been in the focus of research in the last decades for their regulatory roles in vivo and for their use in nano- and biotechnology. However, an understanding of the various factors that drive a particular quadruplex fold remains limited, challenging rational therapeutic targeting and design of these tetrahelical structures. In this regard, insights from modified G-quadruplexes may help to deepen our knowledge of G-quadruplex structure. In this dissertation, sugar-modified guanosine analogs are exploited for their altered conformational preferences regarding both glycosidic bond angle and sugar pucker by their incorporation into different syn positions of the G-core of a model G-quadruplex. Induced structural perturbations as characterized by NMR spectroscopy range from a local change in tetrad polarity to a complete refolding into an unusual structure with a V-shaped loop, a unique G4 structural element in the focus of this work. Detailed conformational analysis of the introduced G analogs and high-resolution structures of the modified quadruplexes reveal a complex interplay of glycosidic torsion angle, sugar pucker preferences and local interactions, which may all play a leading role in driving G4 folding.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172117-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058125-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292871-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375326-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257779-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037005-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832816-9>
Vertex-Tracing : Interactive Ray-Tracing through Adaptive Progressive Refinement in Object Space ¤ The present dissertation describes a procedure for the interactive physically exact simulation of specular reflections and specular refractions in virtual environments. Under the term Vertex-Tracing, this work presents an approach that allows hybrid rendering, enabling the supplementation of traditional hardware rendering with global illumination phenomena. - The core of the Vertex-Tracing procedure is an adaptive progressive ray tracing. In contrast to standard ray tracing, the goal is to exploit existing image coherence by only calculating those pixels (samples) that are required for the reconstruction of the final image. The step-by-step approach to the desired final image is achieved by refining (refinement) the geometry of selected polyhedra. These are scene objects that, due to their visual characteristics, are to be subjected to Vertex-Tracing in the form of specular reflections or refractions. The starting point for the calculation of these objects is their object vertices. These form the point of origin of a primary beam shot from the observer and serve as the starting point for further recursive beam tracing in the sense of classical ray tracing. Depending on the need, new vertices are inserted, which leads to a step-by-step refinement of the object geometry. - The reconstruction of the final image is achieved by bilinear interpolation using graphics hardware. Its use not only allows combined rendering with conventional OpenGL objects, but also enables efficient handling of textures in Vertex-Tracing. In this context, a delayed texture lookup is presented. It prevents a complete sampling of textures, which would be particularly time-consuming for high-frequency textures. - In terms of accelerating the procedure, aspects of distributed, parallel computation are investigated and implemented. In the foreground, the distribution of Vertex-Tracing in the computer cluster and the parallelization of the algorithm on shared-memory machines are in the foreground. Both approaches show that, despite the adaptive progressive character of the Vertex-Tracing procedure, a significant speed-up is achievable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292517-4>
Brücken zwischen Ökologie und Ökonomie : environmental planning and economic knowledge for sustainable regional economic activity ¤ This study was created in the ifo Department of Branch Research and completed in the spring of 2005. The client was the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour. The subject of the study is the current state and prospects of the New Economy in Germany, as well as a comparison with five other member states of the European Community (France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) with regard to the diffusion and effects of the use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). From a methodological perspective, the analyses are based on a meso-economic approach, in which four branches were examined as examples: mechanical engineering, vehicle construction, the banking sector and trade. The question is approached in an interdisciplinary manner. Based on the existing scientific literature on the New Economy, a synopsis of previous results is prepared and, in cooperation with Professor Jan-Egbert Sturm, University of Konstanz, the economic theoretical relationships, in particular the most often not explicitly mentioned assumptions, are uncovered. With the help of econometric estimation methods, various models are tested for the relationship between the use of ICT and the increase in labor productivity. These works were carried out by Cambridge Econometrics, a cooperation partner who has a European, sectoral and country-disaggregated data basis. Qualitative investigations, expert discussions and the evaluation of surveys on the use of ICT have guided the branch experts of the ifo Institute and, using the results from the various analyses, a final evaluation has been created for each individual branch. From the aggregation of the branch results, conclusions are drawn for the current state of diffusion of ICT in Germany and their potential effects on productivity and growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>
Social Democracy as Builder: Town Hall Construction in the 1960s and 1970s in the Federal Republic of Germany and Essen ¤ How many and which town halls were demolished and built in the Federal Republic of Germany between 1960 and 1980? And why did the city leaders decide on these building measures - on changes that are often criticized today as 'deviation' or 'nightmarish'? - - This book answers these questions in detail. Based on the knowledge of developments in 82 West German medium and large cities, the author describes a town hall history in which the actors were initially guided by pragmatic, then by ideological, and finally again by pragmatic considerations. - - The book is particularly aimed at the readers of Essen. For the first time, the exemplary Essen town hall history of the 1960s and 1970s is told, which has become one of the greatest myths of the city's history	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176999-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4348108-5>
Oblique graphs ¤ The subject of this work is the investigation of asymmetric structures in graphs. In particular, it is considered to what extent such structures can occur in graphs of arbitrary size. According to a theorem by Wright, almost all graphs are asymmetric. On the other hand, many results of Ramsey theory show that certain regularities or similarities often inevitably occur in growing structures. The concept of asymmetry is extended in such a way that local similarities are also excluded. Graphs with this high degree of asymmetry are called oblique graphs. In the first part of the work, asymmetric structures in polyhedral graphs are investigated. For this graph class, symmetry properties have been studied in the past. In this work, various type definitions for the faces and edges of a polyhedral graph are presented. A polyhedral graph is oblique with respect to such a definition if no two faces or edges have the same type. The main results of this part of the work are theorems that show the finiteness of the set of such oblique graphs. Furthermore, it can be shown in some cases that every sufficiently large polyhedral graph must contain more than z edges or faces of a common type, where z is an arbitrary natural number. In the further course, the finiteness results on oblique polyhedral graphs are transferred to maps on surfaces of higher genus. In the second part of the work, asymmetric structures in general graphs are finally investigated. A simple graph is called edge-oblique if two vertices differ in the sequence of their neighboring vertices. It is shown that there are infinitely many such graphs even under various additional restrictive conditions. In the final section of the work, random graphs are considered. It is shown that with increasing vertex number, the probability of a random graph being edge-oblique converges to 1. This means that almost every graph is edge-oblique if the probability that a certain edge occurs in the random graph moves within certain, given limits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113782-6>
Development of a Laser Beam Polishing Process for Quartz Glass Surfaces ¤ The goal of laser beam polishing is the fast, uniform, and form-preserving smoothing of the roughness profile of a quartz glass surface. The laser acts in a geometry-independent manner, similar to a fast subaperture tool. Various machined samples are polished using laser radiation, where the process influence parameters, the interactions between laser radiation and quartz glass, and the evaluation of the results in terms of surface quality and influence on stresses or mechanical properties, the investigations and the development of an industrially usable laser beam polishing process are supported. Experimental planning, execution, and evaluation are carried out using statistical methods. The temperature is monitored during polishing with a pyrometer and thermal imaging camera. The application areas of the process include, among others, polishing of 2D and 2½D components, tool insertions (plastic processing), and in parts of optical components.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139080-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031651-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278925-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176622-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175006-8>
Interdisciplinary Cooperation in the Creation of Historical 3D Models ¤ BEGIN: Ausgangslage und Zielsetzung -- Begriffe -- Theoretischer Rahmen -- Bibliometrische Analyse -- Qualitative Literaturanalyse -- Fallstudien -- Zusammenführung der Untersuchungsergebnisse -- Grenzen der empirischen Untersuchung und Ausblick -- Literatur -- Anhang. Sander Münster examines in this book, using social science methods, various aspects of interdisciplinary cooperation in 3D modeling projects of historical content. His scope includes the investigation of the scientific landscape, project constellations, and phenomena and strategies in the creation process. The work offers high practical value through concrete and practice-tested recommendations for the conception and implementation of successful 3D modeling projects. The use of information technologies for processing humanities topics is a highly topical research area, and previous analyses focused on technical, methodological, and theoretical aspects of science. Therefore, this systematic investigation of processes and constellations in projects has been lacking so far.

Exploring the ultrafast excited-state dynamics of transition metal complexes with ab-inito multiple spawning ¤ Since its emergence in the last century, quantum chemistry has become widespread, with a variety of spectra already being calculated routinely. In contrast, modeling ultrafast photochemical processes is still very challenging and limited to small and medium-sized molecules. The steadily increasing computer performance now enables the calculation of large transition metal complexes. However, these pose some challenges for quantum mechanical methods in modeling ultrafast processes due to their high number of electronic states and atoms. Therefore, the goal of this work is to identify methods that can overcome these challenges. For this purpose, the ab-initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method was first selected for the calculation of atomic core dynamics based on a comparison of two promising methods. Subsequently, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) was chosen for the description of the electronic structure, as this method allows for a good compromise between accuracy and computational effort. The limitations of the method were also shown using the example of iron pentacarbonyl. With the selected methods, 500 fs of the dynamics of a transition metal complex with more than 100 atoms were simulated, which represents the largest AIMS calculation for a transition metal complex to date. By comparing the results with experimental findings, the simulation was validated, and further insights into the reaction mechanism of the complex were gained. In addition, the dynamics of the excited states of an experimentally hardly investigated transition metal complex were predicted to demonstrate the potential of the selected methods. In summary, it was shown that the combination of AIMS and TDDFT enables an efficient calculation of the dynamics of transition metal complexes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131837-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068924-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047979-1>
Reintegration Challenges of Expatriates: An Investigation of the Return Shock after International Staff Deployment ¤ Foundations of reintegration after international staff deployment -- Reintegration as a readjustment process in research literature -- Factors influencing reintegration difficulties and return shock -- Requirements for personnel management to ensure successful reintegration measures -- Empirical investigation of reintegration difficulties and return shock of German expatriates returning home. Kristina Mnich conducts a comprehensive literature review on reintegration difficulties of expatriates and the existence of return shock. In an empirical investigation of German expatriates, the author vividly highlights the relevance and topicality of the reintegration problem and illustrates the consequences of return shock.

Network Relationships in the System of Civil Law ¤ The work deals with the legal classification of networks. For this purpose, the understanding of networks in sociology, economics, politics, and geography is first analyzed. Subsequently, the work deals with the recognition of network relationships in the legal order. The legal assessment begins with the question of whether and to what extent relationships between network actors are subject to contract law. A significant challenge is already the bipolar starting situation in most statutory regulations. Furthermore, a survey of the law of societies, property, unjust enrichment, and tort law is conducted. These latter areas of law are particularly important because network-oriented actions do not necessarily have to be in connection with a contractual relationship. Finally, special forms of action are legally considered, which, from an economic perspective, exhibit a particularly high network orientation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047304-1>
Electronic Cross-Border Company Formation ¤ Over the question of whether the German legislator should enable a purely electronic formation of capital companies, a heated discussion has been sparked by the EU Commission's proposal for the SUP Directive. The electronic cross-border formation and in it the guarantee of identity are the subject of the present dissertation. The scientific achievement of this work lies on the one hand in the comprehensive capture of the rich argumentation for electronic formation, its systematic focusing and critical penetration; on the other hand and above all, the investigation provides a critical and forward-looking engagement with the electronic identification means, on which the EU Council has essentially based its compromise in the General Orientation to the SUP Directive in this central question.

Landscape Development in German and Japanese Middle Mountains - Examples from the Black Forest and the Harima Region ¤ The cultural landscape is shaped by the interplay between natural conditions and socio-cultural influences. The middle mountain cultural landscapes in Germany and Japan leave the impression that there is a certain similarity from several perspectives. This was the starting point of the research. In order to test this impression and to capture similarities and differences between the landscapes, a comparative cultural landscape analysis was carried out. Methodically, the historical landscape analysis and empirical social research were combined. As research areas, the Yach district of the city of Elzach in the middle Black Forest, the municipality of Fröhnd in the southern Black Forest, and the Isarigami district of the municipality of Takacho in the Harima region in western Japan were selected. The goal of the research was to compare cultural landscapes in different (world) regions by analyzing the individual components of the landscape. Through a comparative analysis, similarities and differences between them were captured. Subsequently, the regional typical forms of appearance were to be developed. Written sources, historical maps, as well as specialist maps and aerial photographs were evaluated. The cultural landscape elements mapped during field surveys were entered into a GIS program for evaluation and representation. In addition to the GIS-generated maps, sketches and photos served as documentation. Numerous informal interviews with residents supplemented the reconstruction of historical land use.

Homeland. Folk Culture. Architecture : Explorations of Folk-Oriented Building of the Homeland Protection Movement in the Context of Modernity and National Socialism ¤ Around 1900, the Homeland Protection Movement developed an architectural programmatic from the discourse of folk culture, establishing its own, identity-political variant of modernity. Rainer Schmitz examines its emergence and conception by actors of the 1904-founded 'Bundes Heimatschutz' such as Ernst Rudorff, Paul Schultze-Naumburg or Otto March. In the focus of his explorations stands the translation of social phenomena like the 'social question', homeland, folk culture or antisemitism into the building discourse as well as their architecturalization in projects like the national stadiums or the 'German East Colonization'. With this, he contributes, inter alia, to the debate on the construction of collective identities	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122192-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140349-6>
Achieving Innovation Success through Multi-Stage Knowledge Acquisition : A Conceptual and Empirical Investigation in Technical Industries ¤ The MEWI model developed by Oliver Wiesener brings together market and technology knowledge across market stages in the B-to-B field and thus promotes innovation success. The model contains the MEWI phases of planning, knowledge acquisition, knowledge integration, and knowledge exploitation, as well as methods for practical implementation. By using the empirically tested MEWI factors with regard to innovation success, further positive accents can be set. Innovation success is particularly achieved when a product is accepted in the market and is also technologically realizable. The combination of these two aspects is problematic for B-to-B companies, as markets are multi-staged here and technology and market knowledge are heterogeneous across several market stages. This innovation dilemma can be solved by multi-stage knowledge acquisition (MEWI).

Neighborhood and Fear of Crime: An Empirical Investigation of the Collective Efficacy Approach in Urban Comparison ¤ Jan Starcke examines the role of informal social control within neighborhoods in relation to personal feelings of safety and how trust between residents of a neighborhood arises, drawing on the theory of collective efficacy. For the first time, data sets for two German major cities with different socio-structural conditions are analyzed in comparative perspective: Wuppertal and Stuttgart. In the framework of multilevel analysis, it is found that collective efficacy has a different value for the subjective perception of safety in the investigated cities, which calls into question the generalizability of the approach.

Implementation of earthworm-assisted constructed wetlands to treat wastewater and possibility of using alternative plants in constructed wetlands ¤ The aim of this research was to add the earthworms into the constructed wetlands, both in Germany and Thailand, in order to investigate whether they could improve the treatment performances. For Germany, earthworm-assisted constructed wetlands exhibited better treatment efficiency than conventional vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetlands and the unplanted constructed wetlands with earthworms. For Thailand, the production of sludge on the surface of wetlands was reduced by 40% with earthworms. Apart from that, alternative plants with high resource recovery potential were proposed. The recommendation table was developed with 13 suitable species. There are more than one most appropriate species in each climatic region.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Product Design of Climate Protection Funds as a Sustainable Investment Product for Private Investors: An Empirical Analysis of Preferences and Product Requirements of German Retail Investors ¤ Market overview of climate protection funds and their preference-based scoring -- Preference measurement using conjoint analysis -- Importance and content of a label for sustainable funds related to climate protection. Thomas Steiauf reveals in this book the preferences of retail investors for climate protection funds. He works out the importance of classical product features of a fund such as risk and return in comparison to sustainable product features and how these features should be designed. Furthermore, the author shows how investor preferences are perceived by product providers and recommendations are given for the improvement of sustainable funds for three clusters of different investor types. Although the achievement of German climate protection goals requires investments from the private sector, sustainable investment funds related to climate protection currently allocate few funds.

Mathematical Approaches to Solving Multiplication Tables: An Investigation Considering Various Instructional Approaches and the Performance Capabilities of Children ¤ In mathematics education, there is currently a broad consensus regarding the development of the small multiplication table, which corresponds to the contemporary understanding of teaching and learning in mathematics lessons: A comprehension-based development, which provides for the acquisition of unknown multiplication tables using already known multiplication tables and based on insight into operational relationships. The effectiveness of this comprehension-based development has been analyzed in only isolated national and international studies to date. This volume presents an empirical study that captures and examines various mathematical approaches of children to tasks of the small multiplication table in the 3rd school year, and investigates whether and to what extent different instructional approaches in the development affect the use of strategies by children. The investigation of the use of strategies is carried out in addition under consideration of another possible influencing factor, the individual performance capability of a child.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076358-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048716-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151355-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070463-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053504-6>
Steerable Antennas for Mobile Satellite Communication based on the Multimode-Monopulse Principle ¤ This work deals with the design and realization of steerable antennas for mobile satellite communication based on reflector antennas. This antenna type plays a central role for ground station antennas that are supposed to provide high data rates even during the movement of the carrier vehicle. Starting from the presentation of existing systems and the requirements for mobile satellite antennas, the construction fundamentals for the dimensioning of Cassegrain antennas are described. For the steering of this antenna type, various technical principles are available, with a special focus on monopulse technologies in this work. This principle allows the estimation of the pointing error of an antenna in relation to the direction from which the received signal comes, for a limited spatial subset of the antenna's radiation diagram. The direction information generated by this is used in a control loop for the mechanical steering of the antenna. Based on the presented concepts, a demonstrator for an external unit of a mobile satellite terminal is described. This demonstrator consists of a custom-made mechanical antenna positioner and a 60 cm Ka-band Cassegrain antenna, which is equipped with a newly designed TM01 multimode monopulse feed system consisting of a waveguide mode converter. The development of the feed chain is shown from a first variant for pure reception operation to a complete dual-band version for transmission and reception functions. In this context, numerical simulation of the structures and post-manufacturing metrological characterization are addressed. Furthermore, the generation of the error vector, which is required for the steering of the antenna, is described. In addition to the waveguide-based coupler, a novel mode coupler for TM01 multimode monopulse is presented in this work, in which transitions from printed coplanar lines to waveguides are used. This method enables the integration of the coupler together with the transmitter-receiver in the same technology, making it possible to build a very compact, lightweight, and cost-effective feed chain.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173243-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138349-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160442-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267629-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142614-9>
Bifurcations from codimension-one D4m-equivariant homoclinic cycles ¤ The topic of this work is a detailed description of the dynamics near D4m-symmetric relative homoclinic cycles using Lin's method. The homoclinic cycles have codimension-1, i.e., we observe their generic unfolding within a one-parameter family. They consist of several trajectories that converge to the same hyperbolic equilibrium state for both positive and negative time (homoclinic trajectories) and are all dependent on each other through the symmetry induced by a finite group. We take real leading eigenvalues and homoclinic trajectories that approach the equilibrium state along leading directions. The homoclines are located in flux-invariant subspaces. In particular, for such homoclinic cycles in differential equations with Dk-symmetry (Dk is the symmetry group of a regular k-gon in the plane), where k is a multiple of 4, some of these flux-invariant subspaces are orthogonal to each other. This implies the disappearance of the typically occurring terms of leading exponential convergence order in some of the determination equations obtained from Lin's method. To give a precise description of the non-wandering dynamics of such a homoclinic cycle, i.e., a description of the solutions that remain in the vicinity of the cycle in both the phase and parameter space, further information about the remainder terms in the determination equations is required. In this work, we present an improved representation of the remainder terms in the determination equations and identify two further terms with higher exponential convergence rates. Based on this, we discuss the solvability of the resulting determination equations for homoclinic cycles in R4. There are two cases to distinguish, which depend on the size ratio of the two new terms. In one case, we observe a finite subshift. In the other case, the analysis is more difficult, so that we restrict the investigation to periodic solutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139571-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327106-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013396-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078889-1>
Cognitive Science Perspectives on Biblical Vision Narratives: The Transfiguration (Mk 9,2-9) as an Example ¤ Das vorliegende Buch bietet einen umfassenden Beitrag zum Bestreben neuro- und kognitionswissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse in die neutestamentliche Exegese zu integrieren.

Currency Crises: An Empirical Investigation of Contagion Effects and Causality during the Asian Crisis ¤ Since the early 1980s, currency crises have received increasing attention from a scientific perspective. In particular, in retrospect of the Asian crisis (1997/98), both theoretical and empirical approaches have been strengthened to investigate the contagion effects that emerged in this case. The work provides empirical statements on the causes and effects of contagion effects during the Asian crisis. In addition to an analysis of contributions from theoretical crisis research, an in-depth examination of empirical research approaches is first made with regard to the used crisis definition, the investigation method, and the variables examined. At the center of the empirical investigation is a thorough analysis of the contagion effects that occurred during the Asian crisis. It is based on a contagion model, according to which contagion effects are the result of portfolio effects and the herd behavior of poorly informed investors. The empirical investigation of contagion effects is carried out within a two-stage analysis. The first part is formed by a logit regression. It serves to prove the existence of contagion effects and to identify the countries that are severely affected by these effects. In the second part, the sources and transmission paths of contagion effects are examined using dependency analysis. The algorithms used enable statements to be made about dependencies and interdependencies between the examined variables, which can be presented in the form of a causal graph. The findings gained in the analysis steps show that Thailand can be considered as the country of origin of the Asian crisis. With regard to the emergence of crises in Singapore and the Philippines, financial market-based contagion effects can be assigned a leading role.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396352-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003694-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214003-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039798-1>
The Effect of Credibility in Marketing Communication: An Analysis of Short- and Long-Term Effects ¤ Credibility in the context of marketing communication and persuasion research -- Instruments and forms of marketing communication -- Development of persuasion effects over time -- Empirical investigation -- Conclusion. Credible and convincing marketing communication is of great importance for companies. Franziska Küster-Rohde examines the credibility of various design options and checks how these affect a higher effectiveness and persuasiveness of marketing communication. The effect development over time is also considered. The author shows that credibility has generally positive effects, but that this advantage is offset over time and is not sustainable in the long term. The results of her investigation provide valuable indications for a target-oriented design of marketing communication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157500-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201794-4>
Development of an Endoscopic Fiber Probe for Optical Biopsies using Nonlinear Spectroscopy ¤ An early detection and exact diagnosis of diseases such as tumors is essential for optimal treatment and improvement of prognosis for affected individuals. The gold standard for tissue examinations is still histopathology, where painful patient biopsies and complex post-processing of tissue samples are necessary. From tissue removal to diagnosis, valuable time is spent, and in many cases, biopsies must be repeated multiple times until diseased tissue is fully identified and localized. Therefore, new optical technologies have been developed and applied in recent decades to optimize tissue analysis and enable a more patient-friendly treatment. Nonlinear, multimodal in-vivo imaging with CARS (coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering), SHG (second harmonic generation) and TPEF (two-photon excited auto-fluorescence) can offer an attractive solution here, which is non-invasive and enables the detection of microscopic tissue changes in real-time. However, the implementation of nonlinear imaging procedures in an endoscopic design for hard-to-reach tissue sites is still a technological challenge. The present research work presents a fiber-based approach for a multimodal, endoscopic probe, where a multi-core fiber is used to guide the excitation lasers and specially designed GRIN lenses take over the beam formation in the probe head. The probe design is completely without movable parts or the use of electrical power, so that a robust and compact design is achieved. The functionality of the probe is demonstrated with multimodal recordings of thin sections of human skin tissue as well as fresh tissue samples of a pig. Based on the results, it can be shown that multimodal recordings with the presented probe are qualitatively comparable to conventional LSM recordings, and a faster imaging is possible. Thus, the presented probe design has a high potential to be used in future clinical routine examinations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014670-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0>
Physiological characterization and molecular ecological investigation of diverse organisms of the Roseobacter clade isolated from the North Sea ¤ One of the major groups of the marine heterotrophic bacterioplankton is the Roseobacter clade, which is widespread in marine ecosystems. Roseobacters exhibit a remarkably variable physiology and their metabolic activities significantly contribute to processes in the world’s biogeochemical cycles and to the microbial loop of marine food webs. As many roseobacters can easily be cultivated, they became one of the most intensively studied groups of marine bacteria. In this study the Roseobacter community of a water sample from the open southern North Sea was analyzed, which was collected during a bloom of phytoflagellates. Three newly isolated strains were characterized as new species of new genera. For one of the isolates, Planktotalea frisia SH6-1T, the occurrence and abundance in the North Sea was investigated. The results revealed very pronounced seasonal patterns of P. frisia in the German Bight and a possible correlation with phytoplankton. In laboratory experiments with the phytoplankton algae Phaeocystis globosa and Leptocylindrus danicus the bacterial utilization of algal-derived dissolved organic carbon was shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174642-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4430679-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312811-7>
Water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere : on the influence of deep convection ¤ Water vapor is one of the most important atmospheric trace gases. Its influence on the climate, chemistry, and energy balance is significant. Of particular interest is the water vapor distribution in the upper troposphere, especially in the tropics. The main water vapor source for the tropical upper troposphere is tropical convection. It counteracts the large-scale sinking, which has its cause both in dynamics and in the radiation balance. It compensates the convective upward movement and transports relatively dry air downward. Little is known about the net effect of these two processes, especially due to a lack of reliable measurements in this region. In this work, the water vapor content and the mechanisms responsible for the water vapor distribution in the upper tropical troposphere are investigated using a large amount of in-situ humidity measurements. The measurements were carried out on commercial airliners within the EU project MOZAIC (Measurements of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service AirCraft; Measurements of ozone and water vapor on Airbus commercial airliners). A climatology of the measured parameters over the tropical Atlantic shows that the humidity is very variable on all temporal and spatial scales. The bimodal distribution of humidity in the tropics differs significantly from the distribution in the subtropics or mid-latitudes ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297605-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061018-4>
Investigations on the Calculation of the Fatigue Strength of Surface-Hardened Diesel Fuel Injectors ¤ Existing methods and guidelines for the calculation of the fatigue strength of surface-hardened diesel fuel injectors do not provide satisfactory results on their own. In various test series, the relevant transfer factors for the present load cases were quantitatively determined and compared with the calculation proposals derived from the published methods and guidelines. Special attention was paid to the surface finish, the mean stress sensitivity, the local hardness, and the absolute notch size. Based on the transfer factors, a calculation method was presented according to the locally elastic concept. The verification of its applicability using 11 independent test series provided satisfactory results, which are only limited by the scope of the experiments. Potentials for increasing the permissible maximum load were found in the surface quality, the introduction of load-induced pressure stresses, and for needle lift-controlled injection systems in the consideration of the actual operating loads.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128130-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219221-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136513-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4220946-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4390073-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135870-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012211-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4618527-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166844-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123041-3>

Development of a CAE Tool for the Design of Flight Control and Hydraulic Systems ¤ The practical support of the engineer in the design of flight control and hydraulic systems - including the computer - is the focus of this work. Starting from the data that were established during the aircraft design for a new aircraft project. From this, the requirements for the flight control system are derived: What moment is necessary to move the control surfaces of the aircraft in all flight situations? At what speed must the control surfaces be released? What influence does the required reliability have on the design? With the help of these preliminary considerations, the hydraulic, linear actuators of the flight control can then be dimensioned and integrated into the wings or tailplanes. Furthermore, the connection of the actuators to the energy systems and computers of the aircraft is investigated. With the help of a stationary calculation, the hydraulic system is designed. Finally, it is shown how the design of the aircraft systems can be economically evaluated based on the "Direct Operating Costs".	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143715-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113196-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154782-2>
Post-Merger Integration in European-Japanese Corporate Mergers: Conflict-Oriented Analysis at the Example of Supplier Management ¤ Increasingly, European companies are taking over companies in Japan. The success of such transactions is decided by the phase of post-merger integration. Cultural differences between the acquiring European company and the Japanese target company, however, can jeopardize post-merger integration. This is often not known to European buyers. Carsten Herbes analyzes the integration of the procurement area, as synergies in this area often make a significant financial contribution to the success of the company acquisition. He presents the typical integration measures of the acquirer, e.g. joint procurement and conversion of Japanese-specific supplier relationships to market relationships, against the goals of Japanese stakeholders (employees, management, suppliers) and identifies potential conflicts. He illustrates the existing conflict fields and the problems of dealing with conflicts in the overall context of post-merger integration using case studies and develops solution proposals.

Peer Education & Violence Prevention : Theory and Practice presented at the Project Schlag.fertig ¤ The book deals with the topic of violence in adolescence and the peer approach. Detailed theoretical explanations are made about peer involvement, respectively. peer education as a pedagogical method, which is applied in an increasing number of projects. In this context, the peer approach is considered in terms of its practical relevance for participatory work with children and adolescents and especially in terms of its possibilities for violence prevention. The topic of youth violence, which has increasingly come into focus in public and media, is presented and analyzed under consideration of causes and origin and actual occurrence. Characteristics of adolescence, current violence statistics and violence in school are in the focus here. A special focus of the book lies on the connection between peer education and violence prevention. For this purpose, the violence prevention project 'Schlag.fertig' is presented and evaluated. Empirically, the question is addressed whether violence prevention in school can be practiced with the help of peer education. For this purpose, data from school classes are examined that have participated in a 'Schlag.fertig' prevention action. In the 'Schlag.fertig' project, former violent adolescents are trained and develop prevention actions, which they then carry out with school classes. The students of these actions are questioned in writing at three points in time regarding their own (violence) behavior and in terms of the effectiveness of the prevention actions. Both the theoretical foundations and the results of the evaluation are examined in terms of their practical relevance and the possibilities of transfer as well as in terms of critical aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075968-4>
Aspects of Cohesive and Adhesive Properties of PCC ¤ The abbreviation PCC refers here to Polymer modified Cement Concrete, i.e. cement and concrete modified with plastics. This abbreviation has also been internationally established. It denotes materials that, in addition to the mineral binder cement, also contain plastics. Cement and plastics achieve a joint binder effect in the later concrete or mortar. A repeated subject of damage cases is the failure of the bond to other building materials. Since PCC is often applied as a thin protective layer on existing concrete, failure of adhesion will also lead to failure of this protective function earlier or later. Conversely, failure of protection due to cracks in the PCC can also lead to detachment of the coating in the aftermath. The cause of this cohesive failure is usually the selection of incorrect or not matched building material systems or simply processing errors. The goal of this work was to investigate the influence of the cohesive and adhesive properties of PCC on its durability, especially when used as a coating material.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311269-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519047-1>
Fabrication of functional thin-film elements on the front surfaces of optical fibers using high-resolution lithographic structuring techniques ¤ This work deals with the development of technologies for lithographic processes for the production of high-frequency diffractive thin-film building elements directly on the front surfaces of optical fibers. For this, optimized lithographic procedures need to be suitably modified for process execution on wafers. This concerns both the production of layers and the adjustable process parameters as well as the process execution. Depending on the materials used and the structure dimensioning, different functionalities of the structured layers can be generated. For illumination, two systems are used. For the production of structures with periods greater than 3 mym, direct writing laser illumination is used at a wavelength of 442 nm. For the generation of high-frequency grids with periods less than 1 mym, DUV interference lithography is used under the use of an excimer laser emitting at a wavelength of 248 nm. At this wavelength, the interferometric structurability of a resist originally specified for electron beam lithography is investigated, which is particularly well suited for the production of structures on the front surfaces of optical fibers due to its properties such as low moisture sensitivity, high long-term stability, good adhesion, and simplified process execution during development. The suitable illumination and other processing parameters for process execution on substrate layers made of different materials are determined for the realization of high-frequency grid structures. The structuring of metallic layers on the front surfaces of optical fibers leads to fiber-based lithography masks, with the help of which efficient and reproducible photolithography on fiber front surfaces is enabled using fiber-to-fiber illumination. Through direct surface structuring of high-frequency grids on quartz glass optical fibers coated with high-refractive-index layers made of As35S65 using excimer laser interference lithography, efficient fiber-coupled grids with high refractive index contrast are generated. Based on such grid structures, wavelength and polarization filters are designed, suitable illumination conditions are determined, and the properties of realized structures are compared with simulation results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191584-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603135-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136339-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167589-7>
Collecting Things, Creating Knowledge : The History of Natural History Collections in Basel, 1735-1850 ¤ In the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, collecting objects from nature became a scientific practice from a leisure activity of individual private persons. Researchers developed new answers to scientific questions – for example, about the nature of the natural world or the development of living organisms. In natural science museums, this new knowledge could be negotiated and established with a broad public.Flavio Häner traces the history of the natural history collections in Basel, showing how, from this time, not only new scientific disciplines emerged, but a society developed in which questions about nature could no longer be answered by reference to the biblical creation story.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443807-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171301-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203075-4>
Water vapor, precipitation and evapotranspiration isotopic composition in the tropical atmospheric boundary layer ¤ In the tropical areas, important large-scale climatic phenomena, such as the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the monsoons, occur, which influence the global climate to a large extent. One of the areas of the planet where these perturbations exert their effect with a particular intensity is Indonesia. In this region, where the climate is mostly warm and humid throughout the year, these atmospheric phenomena are responsible for the alternation between periods of drought and periods of very intense rainfall with consequences for the agriculture and the tropical forests. The investigation of the isotopic composition of water vapor, precipitation and evapotranspirative water losses in this region can provide important insights into the mechanisms of these phenomena and thus contribute to the improvement of the forecasting possibilities for the precipitation patterns and the climate changes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132825-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219549-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162584-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132260-5>
Influence of Fragmentation and Isolation on the Population Biology and Diaspore Bank of Calcareous Grasslands (Mesobrometum erecti) in Southwestern Germany ¤ To investigate the effects of fragmentation and isolation on species of calcareous grasslands, four species were selected, whose fitness was represented by the examination of six parameters. It could be found that the germination rate in all investigated model species significantly increases with increasing population size as well as the seedling density in the field in two species. In all other fitness parameters, only a few significant results were found. The investigations of the present work show that species-specific reactions to changes in relevant parameters such as population size are of great importance for the persistence of a species. The results of the diaspora bank investigations confirm the statements from the literature that the majority of typical calcareous grassland species are unable to build a permanent diaspora bank. This means that species-rich calcareous grasslands are dependent on a permanent diaspora supply from the current vegetation for their persistence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155138-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4350584-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046800-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274164-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179024-8>
Heavy Metal and Societal Change: A Social History of a Music Culture in the Long 1980s ¤ Heavy Metal is a social force that can tell us a lot about the historical change of our time. Originally a phenomenon of the working class, the music culture has conquered new social milieus, regions, media, and markets since the 1970s. Heavy Metal has become not only the life content of many fans, but also a profession, a musical and commercial experimentation field, and a social instrument of distinction. For the first time, Marco Swiniartzki takes these developments into account on the basis of a broad foundation of sources. Numerous interviews with musicians provide insight into the 1980s and show: The social history of Heavy Metal and the societal change of this time go hand in hand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114114-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284512-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058326-0>
Combined Transport of Rail and Road in Europe: A Comparative Study on the Transformation of Freight Transport Systems ¤ Book description: Truck traffic will double in the next 20 years. And will finally reach the limits of its social and ecological acceptability. But the train will also not be able to handle the freight flows alone. For both, combined transport could be a solution. That's why it has become the most important hope for national and European transport policy. Steffen Bukold shows, based on a detailed three-country comparison between Germany, France and the Netherlands, under what conditions combined transport can arise and grow. Methodically, the question is at the center of whether the success or failure of transport systems is determined by technical progress or is also politically shapeable. A central result is: The shift of traffic from the road to the rail is possible - but only with strong political support.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031830-8>
Long-Wavelength Magnons and Phonons and Roton-Like Excitations in Amorphous Solids ¤ Extended inhomogeneities and variations of nearest-neighbor distances are a characteristic commonality of amorphous solids. Essential information about the (magnetic) structure of amorphous solids can be obtained from the static structure factor or the radial distribution function. For long-wavelength magnons and phonons, the inhomogeneities lead to damping and renormalization (reduction) of the stiffness constants or sound velocities. Very long-wavelength magnons and phonons are scattered at the inhomogeneities like point defects and one obtains a magnon- or phonon-Rayleigh scattering. These results follow both from the Green function theory (Matsubara-Kaneyoshi formalism) as well as - for magnons - from a quantum mechanical perturbation calculation. For magnons and phonons with wavelengths shorter than the average extension of the inhomogeneities, a apparent gap energy follows due to the formation of wave packets (magnon-dressed magnon or phonon-dressed phonon). The density of states of long-wavelength magnons and phonons is changed on the one hand by the renormalization of energy and on the other hand by the redistribution of states due to the inhomogeneities as well as by amorphon states. The latter are a new type of (at small energies localized) elementary excitations that arise due to the amorphous structure. The additional contributions to the density of states of low-energy long-wavelength magnons and phonons are interpreted as a contribution to the boson peak. The thermal conductivity and the inverse thermal resistance of magnons and phonons at low temperatures decrease with increasing strength and increasing spatial extension of the inhomogeneities. In amorphous ferromagnets, the contribution of magnons to the thermal conductivity is not negligible. It can even dominate the phonon contribution. Roton-like excitations (magnon-rotons and phonon-rotons) form as wave packets specific excitation branches in amorphous solids, which can be reduced to the first Debye sphere. This reduction is interpreted as a diffuse umklapp process at the first sharp peak of the static structure factor (FSDP). The magnon- and phonon-rotons, represented by wave packets, lead to a finite gap energy in the roton minimum of the dispersion relation. The size of the gap energy is essentially determined by the width of the FSDP. The reduced dispersion relation of phonon-rotons leads to an additional contribution to the specific heat of amorphous solids for temperatures above 1 K. This is interpreted as a super-Debye contribution (excess specific heat), which is characteristic for amorphous solids. The gap energy of the phonon-roton minimum determines the location of the maximum of the super-Debye contribution. - In amorphous solids, long-wavelength magnons and phonons on the one hand and magnon- and phonon-rotons on the other hand have far-reaching commonalities, which are due to the analogous scattering mechanisms for the long-wavelength excitations as well as the wave packet nature of the roton-like excitations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4765818-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120883-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129373-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312920-1>
Laser Cladding of High-Alloy Duplex Steels ¤ In the present work, the development of corrosion-resistant coatings on the low-alloy pressure vessel steel P265GH is described. The functional layers of duplex steel are produced on a low-mixing basis using the laser cladding process. Depending on the process parameters, 1 to 2 mm thick, almost defect-free layers with a porosity of less than 1% are formed. Due to the high energy density and the resulting locally confined melt pool on the substrate surface, it is possible to achieve a melting rate of less than 3% without bonding errors. The parameters of the laser-based coating process were estimated from numerical calculations and transferred to the existing plant. Main influences are the laser power and the feed of the supplied powder mass flow, in addition to the geometrical alignment of the components to each other. For the welding process, iron-based materials with a Cr/Ni equivalent between 1.5 and 3.4, produced by powder metallurgy, are used. This results in austenite fractions between 100 and 20% in the rapidly solidified microstructure. It should be noted that the microstructure is divided into several zones, which, depending on the local heat supply within the applied layer, exhibit different phase ratios and morphologies. Especially nitrogen has a significant influence on the phase formation of duplex steels. An area-resolved analysis of the nitrogen distribution in the weld microstructure shows that nitrogen, in contrast to the substituting alloying elements chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, is almost completely enriched in the austenite despite rapid cooling. However, chromium nitrides form within large ferrite grains during cooling from the melt. Reasons for this are the low solubility of nitrogen in the cubic face-centered lattice and short diffusion lengths. Finally, the development of a canner-based welding process is shown, which can significantly increase the deposition rate. This results in potential for a laser-based coating process in terms of cost savings and resource conservation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143429-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005996-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1147592918> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150719-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343474-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025214-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242254-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032522-2>
Magnetohydrodynamic duct flow in the presence of a magnetic dipole ¤ Efficient processing of aggressive liquid materials, such as aluminum or copper, often requires knowledge of flow rates and the spatial distribution of the velocity field. It is the declared goal of local Lorentz force anemometry to achieve this. By measuring the Lorentz force, which is induced in the nearby metal by the flow, on a small magnet, however, this force also affects the fluid and distorts the flow profile. The nature of this distortion and whether it changes the measurable force was investigated in the present work using analytical and numerical methods. As a magnetic field, the simplest spatially variable configuration is chosen, a magnetic dipole field. For this, the magnetohydrodynamic equations are investigated in quasistatic approximation, i.e., for small magnetic Reynolds numbers, using direct numerical simulation. Two dimensionless parameters are decisive here: the Hartmann number Ha and the Reynolds number Re. The investigated parameter range exceeds the one achievable in the laboratory experiment, but still provided useful hints for the evaluation of the measurement results. In the present study, the influence parameters for a three-dimensional flow under the influence of an inhomogeneous, local magnetic field were investigated for the first time. The investigations offer interesting perspectives for flow control and, consequently, for flow control.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296739-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236803-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169631-1>
Surface characterization of indium compounds as functional layers for (opto)electronic and sensoric applications ¤ New developments in the field of thin-film synthesis open up a wide range of new applications for indium compounds in the field of sensorics and (opto)-electronics. Against this background, specific aspects of the properties of indium nitride (InN), indium oxide (In2O3) and indium zinc oxide nitride (ITON) were investigated. Future high-frequency transistors based on InN can expand the technological possibilities, while thin In2O3 films are expected to have a high potential for use in cost-effective, integrated ozone sensors. In addition, the optical transparency in the UV range can be expanded for optoelectronic applications by incorporating nitrogen into Sn-doped indium oxide layers. A principle for the implementation of the materials is the detailed knowledge of the influences of the composition, as well as the structural and electronic properties on important mechanisms of the functionality and stability of components. In this context, the influences of process parameters on the surface properties of thin films were investigated, as well as interactions with reactive molecules were analyzed. Thin InN layers were deposited using plasma-induced molecular beam epitaxy, while further investigations were carried out on In2O3 films deposited by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition and ITON layers produced by magnetron sputtering. For analysis, methods of electron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS, AES, (HR)EELS), electron diffraction (RHEED) and scanning probe microscopy (AFM) were used. Through in-situ analysis of InN(0001) layers, correlations between surface reconstructions and the existence of electron states within the bandgap were first demonstrated, as well as influences of oxidation by O2 were investigated. In addition, the interaction mechanism between ozone and defective In2O3-x layers was analyzed and conclusions were drawn on the principle of reversible O3-induced oxidation and UV-induced reduction, which is based on the adsorption/desorption of O-ions and simultaneous charge transfer. The nitrogen introduced by sputtering in N2 is present in ITON in various chemical bonds and changes the optical and electrical properties, but is thermally unstable and desorbs above 550°C, accompanied by simultaneous surface segregation of Sn. This work demonstrates the benefit of combining layer growth and surface analysis to gain fundamental insights for use in semiconductor components.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4289001-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4235053-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172243-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4460230-3>
Development of new methods and catalysts for the hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes ¤ This work is about the development of new methods and catalysts for hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation reactions. It could be shown that cheap potassium hydroxide is a suitable catalyst for the addition of various primary and secondary aryl amines or phenylhydrazine to styrenes to produce pharmaceutically interesting ß-arylethylamines. For Ti- and Zr-catalyzed hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation reactions, 1,1'-diaminoferrocene ligands were synthesized and tested in combination with a precatalyst [e.g. Ti(NMe2)4] for catalytic activity. A promising class of ligands for the synthesis of new titanium-complexes were found to be sulfamide compounds. It could be shown that the combination of a bis-phenyl substituted sulfamide and Ti(NMe2)4 is a good catalytic system for hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation reactions. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001207-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315387-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160579-2>

Integration of Metal-Organic Resin Paste in Low-Temperature Multilayer Ceramic Systems ¤ This dissertation presents the integration possibilities of resin paste in low-temperature multilayer ceramic technology (Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics, LTCC). Resin pastes consist of metal-organic noble metal compounds (e.g. gold, silver, platinum), dissolved in aromatic oils. These pastes can be applied using cost-effective screen printing like classical thick-film pastes. The sintered layer thickness is only 100 nm to 1 [my]m in this case. By etching, these thin burnt layers can be very finely structured. The structure resolution is mainly limited in the single-digit micrometer range by the roughness and warping of the substrates. The use of a fully printed resin layer as a starting point for a galvanic layer build-up is particularly interesting. In this process, the desired structures are galvanically enhanced after a photolithographic process and the starting layer is then etched. The performance capability of the presented fine structuring technology has been successfully demonstrated for focused high-frequency applications. For reliable integration of fully metallic fine-structured conductor tracks in LTCC modules, a combination of tape-on-substrate technology and pressure-assisted sintering is recommended. By this process, the wet-chemical processes of the resin technology are completely decoupled from the flexible and lightweight structurability of the green foils in the unbaked state. In addition to fine structuring, a solderable and bondable layer sequence based on resin pastes was developed. The suitability of this build-up and connection technology was successfully demonstrated for aerospace applications through qualification studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140299-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038906-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174516-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030271-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173503-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4737870-0>

The Reduction of Land Take by Planning Law: Legal Validity and Realization in the Social System ¤ Land take is a well-known problem in Germany. Since the 1970s, politics has been aware of the effects. Time and again, political goals, such as the Federal Government's sustainability strategy, are presented. In this context, planning law plays a crucial role. The work illustrates for the first time comprehensively and in detail that planning law offers a wide range of options for reducing land take and examines whether it is also sufficiently equipped to prevent extensive land take. The numerous measures for reducing land take are presented using examples and precise definitions, and are ranked in a sequence. For each measure, the relevant regulations are presented and weighted. The work covers both the presentation and setting options in the land-use plans, the planning goals and planning guidelines for the balancing act, the planning substitute regulations as well as the measures of special urban development law. Furthermore, the work examines the effect of the regulations relevant to the measures. In this context, the work analyzes, among other things, land management, administrative resource conservation, and possible cooperations, such as through cooperative urban development law.

Transformation Capability Training for Employees in Manual Assembly based on Training Methods from Gymnastics ¤ Transformation capability is a crucial factor for all areas of modern companies (human, technology, and organization) in the face of continuously increasing market dynamics, and therefore receives high attention in research. However, the currently known concepts for improving the transformation capability of companies focus mainly on the areas of technology and organization and do not provide a sufficient systematics and suitable methods for improving transformation capability at the employee level. Against this background, the present work aims to develop a transformation capability training for employees who are active in the organizational unit of manual assembly. To achieve this goal, a series of training modules is developed that target different aspects of transformation capability and application cases in manual assembly. The development of the training modules is based on training methods from gymnastics, which are transferred to application in companies. Prior to this, the plausibility of the transferability from gymnastics to manual assembly executions is checked by comparing both areas on various levels and extracting transferable strategies from gymnastics. The effectiveness of the developed training modules is then exemplified by means of a simulation of assembly. Based on these investigations, a fundamental transferability of training modules from gymnastics to movement executions in assembly is demonstrated. The results indicate an improvement in the execution quality of the defined manual assembly processes. Finally, all training modules are combined into a scalable and comprehensive training concept for employees in manual assembly and equipped with a navigation aid for easy application in companies. This work contributes to the ability to train employees in companies specifically to improve their transformation capability, and thus makes a contribution to the enhancement of the transformation capability of companies as a whole.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040126-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501292-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4248043-7>
Investigations on the Analytics and Diagnostic Utility of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß) and the Soluble Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha (sIL-2Rα) in Dogs ¤ IL-1ß, sIL-2Ra, Dog, dog. - Cytokines are increasingly in the spotlight when it comes to establishing reliable serological markers for the diagnosis of certain disease patterns in dogs. Against this background, two previously little-noticed cytokines in the serum of healthy and diseased dogs were investigated in the present study. The cytokines in question are Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and the soluble Interleukin 2 Receptor alpha (sIL-2Rα), which were determined using a sandwich ELISA. The aim of the investigations was to determine the diagnostic significance of IL-1β in the inflammatory process and of sIL-2Rα in the context of neoplasms and non-malignant internal diseases. The results have already been published (sIL-2Rβ, PRACHAR et al. 2013a) or have been accepted for publication (IL-1β, PRACHAR et al. 2013b). The essential results can be summarized as follows...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113303-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205701-2>

The Effect of Flexible Compensation Components on the Labor Market Considering Business-Economic Aspects ¤ Flexible Wages as a Contribution to Reducing Unemployment For several years, the Federal Republic has been experiencing a phase of high and persistent unemployment. The high costs and social problems force policymakers, decision-makers, and market actors to take committed measures. Unflexible wages, which do not adapt to the market situation, regional, or qualification-specific characteristics, are considered a major cause of high unemployment. Severe structural flaws also contribute to the increase and consolidation of unemployment figures. This book presents approaches to flexibilization, such as performance, success, or capital participation, and examines the added value of these models from a people's and business economic perspective. In addition, the influences on wage- and structurally conditioned unemployment as well as the compatibility with other concepts for solving this social problem are investigated. There are solutions to the problem of unemployment. Can they be realized in this society?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002730-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418272-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4423359-0>
Computer Criminal Law in Comparative Law - Germany, Austria, Switzerland ¤ BEGIN\nMain description: Daniel Schuh presents the amended (§§ 202a, 303a and b) and newly introduced (§§ 202b and c) provisions of the German Criminal Code, as amended by the 41st Criminal Code Amendment Act, to combat computer crime. After explaining the foundations for the reform (Cybercrime Convention and EU Framework Decision), a comparison is made, using selected examples such as phishing and hacking, with the provisions of our neighboring countries Austria and Switzerland. -- The author concludes that the German norms consistently implement the requirements of the Cybercrime Convention and the EU Framework Decision, effectively combat computer crime, and only require minor adjustments. The regulations in the Austrian and Swiss Criminal Code, on the other hand, reveal gaps in criminal liability. Considering the results, the author ultimately submits proposals for amendments to the German provisions.\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010452-7>
Early Stages of Terpene Metabolism ¤ The biosynthesis of the universal terpene building block isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) can occur via the long-known mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway) or via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP pathway) that was discovered in recent years. In plants, the MVA pathway appears to be responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and steroids, while the MEP pathway feeds the biosynthesis of monoterpenes. Through incorporation experiments with deuterium-labeled precursors of both pathways, specific inhibition of both pathways, and due to differences in the natural 12C/13C isotope ratios of the resulting terpenes, it could be shown that this classical assignment is not strictly adhered to in terpenes of the induced scent bouquet of the lima bean Paseolus lunatus and that a participation of the MEP pathway can also be observed in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184779-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3>
Fermenting the Social : Thermal Figures in Social Theory ¤ Elena Beregows study develops a sociology of tempering. It explores societal nature-cultures, thermopolitics, and temporalities through the thermal figures of fire, machine, and the hitherto overlooked fermentation. The latter is at the center of the work and is explored through readings of Marx, Durkheim, Lévi-Strauss, Serres, Latour, and Haraway. The present materialistic discussion of the fermentation metaphor reveals new social theoretical figures of the 'small'. In them, the utopian hopes in the materiality of the social – the new, creative, and unexpected – are just as readable as the 'dark' moments of decay, decomposition, and dissolution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077628-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129537-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059427-0>
Suspension Development and Production Technical Integration from Early Product Development Phase ¤ In the present dissertation, a method is described, with which suspension concepts can be evaluated and optimized with regard to their assembly capability as early as the early development phase. The method is based on a detailed analysis of the development process in the automotive industry. It is shown which roles are responsible within the development for the creation of an axle concept that is producible in the framework of industrial series production. The developed method supports these development activities specifically and thus enables an increase in efficiency.

Influence of Controlled Charging of Electric Vehicles on Grid Operation under Volatile Wind Power Feed-in ¤ The work summarizes findings on controlled charging of electric vehicles (EVs) under volatile wind power feed-in. Based on the state of the art in controlled EV charging, two operational procedures are shown on the basis of procedures currently under development for the exchange of information between EV and charging point for the negotiation of charging processes. The Wind-2-Vehicle procedure (W2V) is an example of the use of controlled EV charging to realize a regenerative power feed-in demand. The Local Load Management (LLM) is an example of using information from the distribution network to limit the charging power of EVs in time. In a case study, fifty EVs are controlled by a reduced W2V approach. In a second case study, it is shown by time series simulations that controlled and uncontrolled charging can lead to violations of established limits in distribution networks. The application of the developed LLM procedure shows that large and small fleets can be controlled charged with a low reduction of the achievable W2V quality, without further violating operationally established limits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151718-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259675-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057472-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166843-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139998-5>
Minimization of Unwanted Throughput Reductions after Failures and Subsequent Re-Starts of Shelf Service Equipment in Automated High-Bay Warehouses ¤ For the control of the widespread technical warehouse type automated high-bay warehouse (aHRL), warehouse operation strategies are applied, which have a significant influence on the characteristic operating behavior of the warehouse system. Considering increased customer demands in terms of delivery reliability and delivery reliability, extended operating times, and reduced exercise of planned maintenance, the question arises as to what contribution warehouse operation strategies can make if, despite high availability commitments from manufacturers, a shelf service device (RBG) fails in an automated high-bay warehouse. Taking into account Geinitz's investigations on throughput reduction after the end of a RBG failure (1998), it is initially necessary to determine that the operating strategy of cross-distribution is insufficiently evaluated in usual operating situations for these purposes. Detailed considerations of the changes in the inventory of an article during and after a RBG failure enable the development of the concept of the 'point of disturbance', to which the observed throughput behavior of aHRL in simulation experiments in connection with a RBG failure can be traced back. On the basis of so-called 'weak' variants of cross-distribution and the first-in-first-out principle, a new warehouse operation strategy is formulated in the form of several optional measures. The concrete design and application of this new operation strategy must be carried out under consideration of a series of circumstances, which depend on the specific operating situation of the respective aHRL. In individual cases, the adapted variant of this new operation strategy enables the minimization of the negative consequences of a occurred RBG failure.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510528-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315222-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451008-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176074-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160187-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034081-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4281434-0>

Theory and Politics of the Housing Market: An Analysis of Housing Policy in Germany with Special Consideration of the Economic Theory of Politics ¤ The peculiarities of the economic good of housing lead to frictions regarding the coordination and allocation processes of the housing market. The author checks whether a market failure on the housing market exists, which could be used as an economic justification for state interventions. Subsequently, the housing policy instruments are analyzed in terms of their goal congruence. As suitable criteria, social accuracy and efficiency are brought to the center of the considerations. The housing policy in East Germany is also included in the analysis. -- As a result, an inefficient and socially inaccurate housing policy can be found in Germany since the Second World War. Rather, the state regulations strengthen or create the coordination and allocation disturbances. -- Using the approaches of the New Institutional Economics and the Public-Choice Theory, the tendency towards a short-sighted, discretionary-interventionist housing policy is explained as a result of interactions between the involved actors. Annette Mayer develops solution proposals that are intended to eliminate the dysfunctional incentives and working conditions of politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043214-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066796-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066794-7>
Physical and Technological Limitations of SNS-Josephson Contacts for Highly Integrated Low-Temperature Superconducting Switches ¤ This work investigates the physical and technological limitations of novel SNS-Josephson contacts in ramp technology. Based on in-situ shot Nb/HfTi/Nb- and Nb/HfTi/Nb/HfTi/Nb contacts, a fabrication technology has been developed that enables the reproducible production of sub-μm contacts down to contact areas of A = 0.03 μm2. The physical properties of the contacts are investigated: temperature and magnetic field dependence of the critical current Ic, influence of microwave irradiation: Shapiro steps, differential resistance. For the realization of superconducting digital electronic circuits (SDE), the current-carrying capacity of sub-μm Nb wiring is measured and the fringe factor is determined. It is shown that the novel Josephson contacts are suitable for the production of series circuits, which are used in Josephson voltage standards. Furthermore, the feasibility of the novel contacts in superconducting digital logic circuits in Rapid-Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) implementation is verified.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134801-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162777-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058651-0>
Stochastic satisfiability modulo theories : a symbolic technique for the analysis of probabilistic hybrid systems ¤ This thesis considers symbolic techniques for reachability as well as expected-value analysis of probabilistic hybrid discrete-continuous systems, being based on a probabilistic logic called stochastic satisfiability modulo theories (SSMT). Due to the expressive power of this logic, the step-bounded dynamics of probabilistic hybrid systems can be encoded by SSMT formulae. Aiming at an automatic analysis procedure, a substantial part of the thesis is devoted to algorithms for solving SSMT problems and to algorithmic enhancements improving performance. Applicability of the resulting bounded model checking procedures is demonstrated on a realistic case study from the domain of networked automation systems. To overcome the limitation of step-boundedness, the thesis introduces a generalized concept of Craig interpolation and shows its use in probabilistic model checking of finite-state systems. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510314-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057633-4>
The SE-Betriebsrat: Application Requirements and Design of Industrial Co-Determination by the SE-Betriebsrat by Agreement and by Law ¤ The core theme of this work are the requirements and contents of industrial co-determination by the SE-Betriebsrat by agreement and by law. In this context, the extent to which the social partners can negotiate a tailored and SE-specific participation agreement through their fundamental agreement autonomy is examined in particular. The limits of this autonomy against the background of the provisions for the SE-Betriebsrat by law have been treated very „stepchildishly“ in the literature so far. The inclusion of exemplary participation agreements from practice rounds off the examination of the theoretically permissible and purposeful agreement options.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126014-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4776680-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257750-0>
International Protection of Privacy from Intelligence Surveillance: Intelligence Surveillance of Telecommunications of Individuals in the Light of the IPpbR and the ECHR ¤ The dissertation examines intelligence surveillance of private telecommunications and its compatibility with the international human right to privacy in Art. 17 ICCPR and in Art. 8 ECHR. These articles provide a comprehensive protection against the most modern forms of surveillance, including mass surveillance. Specific criteria apply to the determinacy of surveillance laws. Surveillance must be approved and controlled by independent authorities and effective remedies must be available. Furthermore, the study investigates to what extent the surveillance state and the host state violate their human rights obligations in cross-border surveillance. The central question is whether the existing definitions of "jurisdiction" are applicable to this extraterritorial scenario. Extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction can also rely on control over certain human rights relevant objects. According to this approach, telecommunications data are objects relevant to the right of the individual to correspondence and data protection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7732308-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016056-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059360-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134175-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121337-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019737-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123980-5>
Optical Coherence Tomography with Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation ¤ In this dissertation, the concept and realization of laser-based optical coherence tomography in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range - briefly XCT - are treated. XCT is a three-dimensional microscopy method that can achieve an axial resolution of a few nanometers. A XCT model for reconstructing the axial sample structure was developed, which includes the interaction between XUV light and the sample to be investigated. The new microscopy method, which has only been demonstrated at synchrotron sources so far, has been implemented with a laser-based XUV source on a laboratory scale. By generating high harmonics of infrared laser radiation, a broadband XUV source with sufficient flux in the silicon transmission window of 30eV - 100eV was realized. A completely revised and adapted XCT microscope was designed and built, so that XCT can now be used routinely. The achieved axial resolution is comparable to the resolution of about 20nm achieved at the synchrotron. Furthermore, a new one-dimensional phase reconstruction algorithm is presented, which is able to uniquely reconstruct the sample structure from the XCT signal, which was not possible so far. Through XCT measurements, a thin layer was found in a sample that was not part of the originally planned sample structure. The existence of this layer and thus the XCT measurement could be confirmed by a measurement with a transmission electron microscope. XCT in its realized form has application fields in the three-dimensional investigation of (multi-layer) coatings, for example, of optical or XUV mirrors, functional axial structures in solar cells or axially structured semiconductors such as graphene-based electronics. Even the imaging of biological laterally homogeneous membranes is conceivable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4387896-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215608-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195932-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264163-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166807-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145435-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1133103480> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7727641-3>
The Whole-Nation Bias in Empirical Research: Theory and Empirics at the Example of Democracy Measurement in 18 Federal States ¤ In this book, the Whole-Nation Bias, a highly relevant distortion problem for comparative country research, is subjected to an empirical investigation and an extensive theoretical exploration for the first time. In the theoretical part of the book, a conceptual differentiation of the Whole-Nation Bias is carried out. Furthermore, Felipe Böttcher sketches the occurrence, possible manifestations, and consequences of this distortion problem. The empirical assessment aims to quantitatively represent the magnitude in different state contexts. In an extensive data collection, 6,150 indicator values were calculated for 410 regions in 18 federal states, and thus the quality of democracy was recorded both on the subnational and national levels of these countries.

Consideration of Statistical Surface Characteristics in Numerical Simulation of Hydrodynamically Acting Radial Thrust Bearings in the Mixed Friction Regime ¤ The subject of the present scientific work was the investigation of whether a description of the pressure components in the mixed friction regime of a hydrodynamically acting radial thrust bearing is possible by considering experimentally determined statistical surface characteristics. Furthermore, it was checked which surface-determined characteristics are suitable for surface definition in the simulation. Based on the model approach of load distribution in the mixed friction regime, two separate models were created for the respective pressure components.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125574-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021262-2>
System Justice and Coherence: Legislative Unity and Diversity through Constitutional and Union Law ¤ Peter Dieterich examines and compares the constitutional postulate of 'system justice' and the union law figure of 'coherence'. In total, the work leads the charged debate about legislative rationality requirements back to their legitimate normative core. -- The analysis of the justifications of a rule of system-just legislation (in particular, the principle of equality, the rule of law, and the principle of proportionality) shows that this only leaves a very narrow scope of application: It stands alone against evident contradictory justifications for infringements of fundamental rights. -- For the union law principle of coherence, two functions can be identified in justifying infringements of fundamental freedoms: As a justification ground, it remains limited to a qualified (primarily tax law) compensation argument, as a justification limit, it forms a legitimate intensification of the suitability test, which largely corresponds to the constitutional system binding.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189803-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139923-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126269-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122326-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048786-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4>
Effects of Digitalization on Teaching and Learning Processes: Didactic Changes at the Example of the FernUniversität in Hagen ¤ Christina Gloerfeld examines changes caused by digitalization in the complex processes of teaching and learning in the higher education sector. Using an analytical framework model developed by her, the author identifies concrete effects and shows that not only a shift of teaching and learning activities to the digital space takes place, but also a didactic relocation of teaching and learning processes towards cybernetic approaches. In doing so, she works out four development trends – de-bordering, standardization, professionalization, and politicization. However, a transformation of teaching and learning processes from a didactic perspective has not yet been shown.

Amphiphilic carbohydrate-containing compounds for multifunctional nano/macro structures ¤ In living organisms, carbohydrate-containing compounds, such as glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycolipids, play key roles in numerous physiological and pathological events via carbohydrate-protein interactions amplified by “glycol-cluster effect”. Inspired by the multifunctional natural glycoconjugates, huge synthetical carbohydrate-containing compounds in the form of polymers and surfactants have been produced and applied in our daily life. In this study, renewable and biodegradable cellulose had been chosen as the biopolymer backbone during the synthesis of carbohydrate-containing polymers. The developed amphiphilic carbohydrate-containing compounds showed a variety of applications, including the formation of nanostructures that can serve as carriers for drugs, genetic material, and other biomolecules. Additionally, the amphiphilic carbohydrate-containing compounds were used to produce macrostructures of interest in biomedicine and materials science.

Full-Day Education and the Concept of Regional Learning 21+: Empirical Study on the Development of Interdisciplinary Educational Offers on the Topic of Globalization ¤ Carolin Duda, research assistant at the University of Vechta, investigated under the leadership of Professor Dr. Martina Flath in her study "Full-Day Education and the Concept of Regional Learning 21+ - Empirical Study on the Development of Interdisciplinary Educational Offers on the Topic of Globalization", how additional, interdisciplinary learning offers in the afternoon influence the learning behavior of students at full-day schools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125746-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034364-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049029-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155947-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4668206-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153520-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0>
Prevalence of Salmonella spp. in primary poultry production and broiler slaughter: Salmonella entry in slaughter poultry during the slaughter process ¤ Salmonella, prevalence, poultry. - Salmonellosis, despite declining numbers since 1992, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses. The entry of Salmonella into the food chain poses a permanent threat to human health. Contamination with Salmonella can occur at various stages of the food chain, making it essential to intervene early on in the food chain and identify and evaluate potential contamination risk points. The aim of the study was to uncover important entry points for Salmonella by determining the prevalence at various stages of the food chain, in order to better respond to critical points with measures. To this end, the entry points of Salmonella were investigated from the stage of the broiler master and possible pathogen sources during rearing were weighed, evaluated, and possibilities for rectification developed. In this study, 10 broiler herds, which were raised on 5 different farms, were examined. The sampling was distributed over two time periods to be able to recognize seasonal influences. The first sampling took place between the months of March 2009 to April 2009, the second investigation took place in the period between July 2009 to September 2009. The sampling of the samples took place at various stages of the food chain. In the examined herds, a total Salmonella prevalence in the herds of 14.29% was determined by Salmonella-positive sock swab samples. The herd prevalence showed a large range of variation, ranging from 0.00% in the herds of two fattening farms to values of 66.66% in the herd of another farm. The cloacal swabs taken in the slaughterhouse showed a total prevalence of 3.52%. In the further course of the food chain, a Salmonella prevalence of 9.50% was found in the brine water dripping from the carcasses. Regarding the increase from the total prevalence of the cloacal swabs from 3.52% to 9.50% in the brine water dripping samples, a significant increase in prevalence is shown. In the further course...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4632576-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178963-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318700-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116389-8>
Freiraum or Territory of Authority: Human Right to Access and International Principles as Limits to State Action in the Internet ¤ The author deals with the question of whether and how international limits can already restrict the power of states in the internet today and how they could look like in the future. In particular, he addresses a human right to access the internet. A focus is on the freedom of opinion and information on the level of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, which are examined from the perspective of various dimensions of intervention. For this purpose, an extensive evaluation of existing documents and case law is carried out. Subsequently, the author provides his own proposal for a human right to access the internet de lege ferenda. Due to the qualification of the internet as an international (over-)space, further international limits, which arise in particular from the field of environmental law, the rules of international relations, and humanitarian law, are examined for their transferability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191103-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063693-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077776-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6>

Interactions between Organization and Social Software in Knowledge Work ¤ Knowledge enables companies to build a long-term competitive advantage. Social software is often used for knowledge work, but its implementation in the company does not always proceed satisfactorily. Simone Kansy therefore examines the influence of the organizational structure on the use of social software in knowledge work and the implications resulting from its use for the organization. The author develops an integrative framework based on aspects of business informatics, organizational theory, and sociology in order to subsequently demonstrate the importance of the organizational structure for the use of social software through a comparative case study analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7550143-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115464-2>
Deinstitutionalization through organizational change : Self-determination and participation of people with disabilities as a challenge for change processes in organizations ¤ This work addresses the question of how the reforms of residential services of the so-called disability care, which are demanded under the term deinstitutionalization in special education, can be realized through a change of the addressed organizations. The core of the work is an empirical study on the decentralization and regionalization of a large and complex institution. For the theoretical foundation of the study, the special education discourse on the topic of deinstitutionalization is retraced and supplemented and further developed by an institutional sociological perspective of neoinstitutionalism. The qualitative study analyzes the structural and content-related aspects of the change of the large and complex institution in their interaction. The results show the complexity of the change processes, especially with regard to the everyday reality of residents in stationary settings. By linking the empirical results to the deinstitutionalization theory (special education and neoinstitutionalism), key elements of an active strategy of deinstitutionalization are derived. The study understands itself as a system-questioning and active contribution to the development of knowledge on the production of self-determination and participation of people with disabilities.

Social Policy between Tradition and Modernity: State Regulations at the Intersection of Labor Market Integration and Reproduction in Germany, France, and Spain ¤ The study inquires into the explanatory power of traditions for the divergence of employment-related social policy regulations. Based on a historical analysis of developments and tradition lines, it is shown at the example of Germany, France, and Spain that different cultural traditions have developed here, which have a specific understanding as a consequence. Based on the concept of secondary care arrangements developed in the historical analysis, a categorization of contemporary regulations is carried out. In this process, a theory of different modernization strategies is developed, which provides a basis for further research and, in particular, also beyond the analyzed countries, has explanatory power for the diversity of regulations; it thus offers a point of approach to a culturally sensitive understanding in the field of social policy research	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016418-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120509-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002737-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278357-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018368-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018210-1>
Self-similar Polyhedra ¤ In the present work, in addition to the k-replicating convex and non-convex polygons, k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra with d ≥ 3 are also studied. So far, very little is known about such polyhedra. E. Hertel has investigated the 8-replicating three-dimensional simplexes [14] and determined a class of 2d-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra [16]. Furthermore, there is a remark by Ch. Bandt that one can obtain 2-replicating polyhedra by product constructions, for example, of two right-angled triangles [1]. A conjecture by McMullen states that for d ≥ 3, every k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to a Cartesian product of simplexes [5, p. 88]. Just as one can construct decompositions of the plane into pairwise congruent polygons using k-replicating polygons, one can construct corresponding decompositions of the d-dimensional Euclidean space using k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra. Decompositions of the d-dimensional Euclidean space into pairwise congruent polyhedra are the subject of numerous works (e.g. [6], [10]). Another application can be found in applied numerical analysis. If one has a decomposition of a region into k-replicating polyhedra, this decomposition can be refined without changing the shape of the decomposition parts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175161-9>
STM study of bare and copper covered ceria thin films ¤ The outline of this PhD thesis is concerned with the study of morphologic and electronic characteristics of cerium dioxide (111) thin films on a ruthenium (0001) crystal as a model system for heterogenous catalysis. The focus in this thesis is on oxygen vacancies in the O-Ce-O oxide layers, which control the catalytic activity of the model system and are introduced by annealing the film at highly reducing conditions. Under the same focus is the distribution of the copper nano-particles on the surface of the oxide films. Copper rather prefers to donate charges to Ce ions in the film that consequently transform from Ce^4+ to Ce^3+. Clear evidence for this comes from XPS investigations. The impact of the copper ad-particles on the degree of reduction is strong enough to drive the highest degree of reduction from former 17% to over 50% in the near surface regime. This means the amount of Ce^3+ ions in the film is comparable to that of the bixbyite stoichiometry of ceria (Ce_2O_3). <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076787-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147480-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277879-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033734-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252995-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2>
Steuerung Virtueller Communities : Instruments, Mechanisms, Interdependencies ¤ In Virtual Communities, individuals communicate and collaborate with each other over the Internet, where cooperation is mostly voluntary and without financial incentives. Companies use Virtual Communities, among other things, for customer relationship management and knowledge management. In universities, virtual learning networks are intended to increase interaction between students and improve learning outcomes. However, the potential of Virtual Communities is often not fully exploited, as complex motivation structures make systematic member management more difficult. Stefan Stieglitz develops a framework that enables a systematic build-up, operation, and especially the control of Virtual Communities. To this end, he analyzes structures and functional processes in open-source projects and identifies control instruments that he transfers to other types of Virtual Communities. In two case studies, he tests the framework under real conditions in an expert network of a stock exchange and a university learning network. In the final analysis, the author shows the effects of competitive, cooperative, and hierarchical control instruments in Virtual Communities.

Bibliotheksflirt : Library as Public Space ¤ Is the flirt between two users meant or the flirt with the library as a public space? The newly published book Bibliotheksflirt: Library as Public Space deals with the question, among other things: Why do people go to the library or what happens in the interpersonal area during a library visit. Are it really just the holdings and information services that people are drawn to in libraries? For far too long, we have only looked at the classical tasks of our institutions - and a wide range of other functions that the library location has, have been almost completely ignored. But is there not more than just an "aura of erudition" and the famous "Pssst" in the air in libraries? For "Bibliotheksflirt - Library as Public Space", extensive conversations were conducted and documented with library users and designers. The result is a mosaic of human motivations that go beyond the classical performance requirements, but also take on the design mandate that goes hand in hand with the characteristic features of these institutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122898-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138534-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075001-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172385-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006439-6>
Development of a Concept for Modeling and Evaluation of Workflows ¤ Business Reengineering, workflow management, and the use of business standard software applications lead to new requirements for the design of information systems. The development of reference architectures, models, and systems is of great importance here, as such reference instruments can normalize concept systems, delimit and systematize system components. The book deals with the design of computer-supported business processes and organizational structures using workflow management systems. It provides a comprehensive methodological instrument for modeling and evaluating business processes and workflows. The presented concept includes the complete cycle of a business process, starting from the development of business strategy, through business process analysis and restructuring, as well as modeling, to more detailed workflow modeling, simulation, and execution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069386-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2>
Global Conflicts or Global Governance? : Continuity and Change of Global Conflict Lines after the East-West Conflict ¤ Does the end of the East-West conflict also mean the end of system-forming global conflict lines? This question is examined by means of an analysis of six world conferences - from the UNCED 1992 to the Fourth World Women's Conference 1995. The empirical findings of the case studies are contrasted with various popular scenarios of international politics, such as the 'Clash of Cultures'. Since the conflict lines found do not correspond to any of these scenarios, a new model of international conflict dynamics after the end of the East-West conflict is designed. At the center of this model is the simultaneity of development and coordination dilemmas, which should be taken into account in the future discussion of Global Governance just like the analyzed conflict lines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075770-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162071-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130238-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164958-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4698151-2>
Characterization and Simulation of Sequentially Processed CIGSSe Solar Cells with Chemically Graded Absorber Layer : Possibilities and Limitations of a One-Dimensional Approach ¤ In this work a one-dimensional (1D) modelbased on the photovoltaic simulator SCAPS-1D has been developed to describe the properties of industrially processed CIGSSe solar cells. In consequence of the large-scale and sequential production sequence, chemical and microstructural inhomogeneities are observed in the device. In order to accurately image these features in the simulation, each functional layer has been characterized separately first. The required dimension reduction was realized subsequently by averaging of the experimental input parameters, determined before. Electrooptical measurements on the investigated solar cells can be predicted quantitatively by the acquired model. An error estimation of the incorporated simplifications and not considered multidimensional effects proves the capability of the 1D approach. Simulative motivated modifications in the solar cell configuration could be implemented in production and led to increased conversion efficiencies. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137456-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150833-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2>
Biobased Plastics with Cellulose Fiber Reinforcement: Relationships between Structure, Adhesion, and Mechanical Properties ¤ composite; cellulose fibre; short fibre-reinforced thermoplastics; mechanical properties; Rayon; polylactide; fibre-matrix adhesion; biobased; bioplastics; interface The present work is concerned in general with short fiber reinforced plastics and in particular with fully bio-based composites consisting of a thermoplastic matrix and a cellulosic reinforcing fiber (Rayon). The aim was to clarify structure-property relationships and identify advantageously acting structures. The composites were prepared by melt mixing and injection molding and characterized for their physical and chemical structure as well as for the corresponding mechanical properties. Starting from the model composite consisting of polylactide (PLA) and Rayon fibers the structural parameters fiber content, fiber diameter, fiber length, fiber toughness, matrix crystallinity, and, in particular, fiber-matrix adhesion were studied. It could be shown that by changing and tailoring the fiber-matrix adhesion the properties of PLA-Rayon composites can be adjusted in a wide range. The principles could be almost completely transferred to further bio-based plastics such as PHB, PBS, PBAT or PA.

Innovative XUV and X-ray plasma spectroscopy to explore warm dense matter ¤ In summary, this work is devoted to the exploration of defined states of warm dense matter. This knowledge is of outstanding importance for laser-fusion research, the study of high-density matter states, as well as a variety of astrophysically relevant questions in plasma research. The present work shows innovative methods for the generation and characterization of warm dense matter. This non-equilibrium state between cold solid and ideal plasma is created by experiments with high energy density. Its properties were studied with high precision. The generation of a defined state of warm dense matter with the help of high-intensity optical short-pulse lasers is challenging. High-energy electrons from a small, hot plasma on the target front surface heat the cold matter through collisional ionization. High spectral and spatial resolutions are necessary to avoid averaging over different plasma states. The author applies advanced X-ray spectroscopy of characteristic emission lines, followed by numerical data processing. The result contains many information, as the line shape is influenced by the plasma parameters and the X-rays are also transparent to solid densities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7843792-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046265-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139081-7>
Assistance Systems in Industry 4.0: Labour Law and Data Protection Law Issues in an Automated Work Environment ¤ Das Werk widmet sich der Arbeit in der Industrie 4.0, einer Entwicklung, bei der alle realen Prozesse in der Fabrik digital erfassen und so noch stärker automatisiert werden sollen. Für die Beschäftigten bringt dies Chancen, es droht aber auch Dequalifizierung und umfassende Überwachung. Im Arbeitsrecht werden deswegen die rechtliche Bindungskraft der menschengerechten Gestaltung der Arbeit und die Mensch-Maschine-Kollaboration untersucht. Im Datenschutz steht die Frage im Mittelpunkt, inwiefern die effiziente Organisation der Arbeit eine intensive Datenverarbeitung rechtfertigt. Dazu wird in Abgrenzung beider Rechtsgebiete ein neuer Lösungsansatz vorgestellt, abgeleitet aus dem Zusammenspiel deutscher und europäischer Grundrechte. The work is dedicated to work in Industry 4.0, a development in which all real processes in the factory are to be digitally recorded and thus automated even more. This brings opportunities for employees, but also threatens de-skilling and comprehensive monitoring. In labour law, the legal binding force of the humane design of work and human-machine collaboration are therefore being examined. In privacy law the central question is to what extent the efficient organisation of work justifies intensive data processing. To this end, a new approach is presented, which is derived from the interplay of German and European fundamental rights and which differentiates between the two areas of law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1072179776> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002769-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690490-6>
Investigations on ABC and MFS transporters of Streptomyces spp.  ¤ Abstract: ABC (ATP binding cassette) and MFS (major facilitator superfamily) transporters are the two largest families of membrane proteins involved in the import and export of substances across biological membranes. Members of these families have been described for the up-take of a variety, necessary molecules which belong to cell metabolism or for the efflux of toxins and multiple structurally unrelated drugs. In this work ABC and MFS transporters of two Streptomyces spp. have been investigated for their implication in the biosynthesis of two secondary metabolites.Rishirilide B is a type II PKS metabolite produced by Streptomyces bottropensis Goe C4/4 and its gene cluster includes four transporter genes, rslT1-4. An ABC transporter is encoded by rslT1-3 which were predicted to compose an amino acid importer system defined by the substrate binding protein (SBP) RslT1. The multidrug transporter encoded by rslT4 belongs to the MFS and its transcription is controlled by RslR4, a MarR regulator. Inactivation experiments of these transporter genes were performed by Redirect© Technology in the cosmid cos4 which contained rishirilide cluster, for its heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus J1074. Deletion and overexpression experiments of rslT1-3 indicated the capacity of the importer system to affect rishirilide B production. It was therefore suggested that the ABC transporter is responsible for the uptake of a precursor needed for the biosynthesis of rishirilide B. Isobutyryl was proposed as the starter unit for the PKS biosynthesis of rishirilide B and was described to derivate from the valine catabolism. Based on these assumptions, RslT123 was suggested to be involved in the import of this amino acid. Attempts to purify the SBP to prove its substrate specificity failed. Furthermore, deletion and overexpression experiments of the MFS transporter RslT4 and its regulator RslR4 led to the proposal of a regulatory mechanism for the biosynthesis and export of rishirilide B. However, rishirilide B production increased in the ΔrslT4 mutant indicating that another transport mechanism of the host took over the function. The multidrug efflux capacity of RslT4 was determined by MIC and disc diffusion assays.In addition, analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. Tü6071 was executed with the help of the bioinformatics platform Galaxy with a focus on transporter genes. S. sp.

The Odeion in the Artemision of Ephesos ¤ In the 125 years of research, the legendary temple of Artemis was always the focus of the archaeological fieldwork, while the once densely built up sacred enclosure remained unexplored. Since 2009 the Austrian Archaeological Institute investigated for the first time a roman building southwest of the Temple, which was up to the present named ‘Tribune’ and whose function could be finally clarified. Due to close typological parallels as well as equipment and furnishing, the building can be identified as roman Odeion of the Early Empire	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129464-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172360-0>
Acceptance of Ecological Product Alternatives: A Schema-Theoretical Consideration Using Implicit and Experimental Test Procedures ¤ Environmental protection is a topic of high relevance for consumers, but it is not reflected equally in consumer behavior.

Binuclear CuA formation and the influence of calcium ions on metal cluster maturation in recombinant nitrous oxide reductase from Shewanella denitrificans ¤ Summary: Nitrous oxide has a deleterious effect on our global climate and its level in the atmosphere is on a steady rise. In the stratosphere, various NOx compounds generated from nitrous oxide lead to ozone depletion. The enzyme nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR), found in denitrifying bacteria uniquely reduces nitrous oxide to dinitrogen, but depends on anoxic conditions. Nitrous oxide reductase is a 130 kDa, homodimeric multicopper enzyme that contains the catalytically active tetranuclear CuZ site and the mixed-valent, dinuclear CuA center for electron transfer. In recent years, structures of nitrous oxide reductases from a variety of different bacteria were published.In this thesis, the first crystal structure of Shewanella denitrificans nitrous oxide reductase, heterologously expressed in E.coli, was solved. The apo form of N2OR shows a dimeric structure, that is almost identical to native N2OR structures, but shows flexible regions near the CuA binding site. The structural flexibility enables the copper incorporation into the cluster binding sites of the dimeric protein. Calcium ions play a crucial role in the stabilization of the CuA cluster and the CuA assembly process. We have shown that calcium ions can close the entry point for copper ions at high calcium concentration, whereby the CuA binding site gets stabilized. Under physiological conditions calcium ions have a positive effect on CuA assembly.The process of CuA assembly on SdN2OR was investigated by Stopped-flow spectroscopy by addition of copper ions to the wild-type protein and several variants. These experiments allow the postulation of a assembly mechanism with one intermediate species, namely a type 2 copper site. By studying N2OR variants where the Cys and His ligands are mutated, we propose a complexation of the T2 copper site by the residues Cys613 and His617. The mutation of both active site cysteine residues results also in very low accumulation of the T2 copper site and its reduction, which suggests that electrons can be provided as well by intermolecular disulfide bond formation.The crystal structure of Pseudomonas stutzeri N2OR form I shows a flip of CuA-coordinating residue His583 towards the protein surface during the turnover of N2O. We were able to mimic this open state by substitution of this histidine residue and reconstitution of the CuA site in vitro, which is the basis for further investigations	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076388-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033217-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033734-0>

Reliable and manufacturer-independent medical device interoperability - Contributions to the IEEE 11073 SDC standard family ¤ Medical devices in today's hospitals are almost always isolated systems, which do not transmit information to or interact with external devices. At the most, this is possible within closed company ecosystems. Thus, this work introduces the new IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) family of standards, which provides manufacturer-independent interoperability. Three fields of application are considered: safe activation of a device's functionality, dynamic association of a random number of remote-control elements and remote-controllable operations, and distributed alarm systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841015-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7620525-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4760029-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038281-3>
Anion receptors based on hydrogen and halogen bonding ¤ The development of selective anion receptors, which enable the targeted detection and binding as well as the transport of relevant anions, has been one of the most important research areas in supramolecular chemistry for many years. So far, these receptors have been based mainly on the donation of hydrogen bonds, but in recent years, halogen bridge donors have also come into focus. In contrast to the hydrogen bridge, the closely related halogen bridge exhibits higher directionality, a larger covalent bond component, and a stronger interaction with a Lewis base partner, thus enabling the construction of potentially more selective receptors. A significant heterocycle, which enables the simple implementation of halogen bridges in various systems through its modular access, is the halogenated 1,2,3-triazole or the corresponding triazolium salt. This building block allows for strong polarization of the halogen and thus very efficient halogen bridge donation. Within the framework of the dissertation, the great potential of halogen bridge bonds was exploited using particularly efficient and modularly accessible halogenated 1,2,3-triazole and 1,2,3-triazolium building blocks, and was worked on in various sub-projects: 1) Construction of preorganized systems and investigation of the thermodynamic influence in solution. 2) Construction of ion pair receptors and investigation of their cooperative properties in solution. 3) Utilization of the high binding strength and reversibility of halogen bridge bonds for the construction of functional polymeric architectures and their application as self-healing materials	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186040-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158874-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196361-1>
The City Before the Gates : Lüneburg and its Hinterland in the Late Middle Ages ¤ The medieval city did not end at its walls. In multiple respects, the medieval urban space extended beyond its inner area and structured the supposedly empty field beyond the narrower border. This included forests, gardens, and other plots of land in bourgeois and communal ownership, industrial enterprises (brickworks, mills, quarries) and supply facilities (wells) as well as military fortifications (landwehr). Urban governance rights in the hinterland were equally a focus of the city council's policy as were the trade routes necessary for the economic success of a city and its merchants. Niels Petersen reconstructs in detail the hinterland of the Hanseatic and salt city of Lüneburg, which belonged to the largest cities in North Germany in the 15th century, and integrates the results into the city-hinterland research and the newer 'space' discussions. It becomes clear that the urban space - also in Lüneburg - is not abstractly definable, but is practically and symbolically created and perceived as such.

Probabilistic Lifetime Models for Thermomechanical Fatigue of Solder Joints in CSP Components ¤ Abstract: The goal of the present work was the creation of a reliability model for Chip Scale Package (CSP), by means of which the lifetime of components under changed environmental loads, or newly developed components, can be estimated. A prerequisite for this is the determination of basic data for the representation of component reliability with package forms such as µBGA (Micro Ball Grid Array) and QFN (Quad Flat No Lead), as well as with lead-free solders under thermal cyclic loads. In the work, all relevant influencing factors that affect the lifetime of the components are to be found and implemented in a possibly universal reliability model for the different CSP. The investigated package forms include various µBGA and QFN. The focus of the investigations lay in the thermomechanical questions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074631-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195776-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034837-4>
Personality Research and Internet Use ¤ The work contributes to the understanding of the relationship between personality and internet use. In the theoretical part, personality psychological and media psychological theories and approaches are presented and integrated into various causal models of the relationship between personality and online behavior. The empirical part of the work consists of three independent studies. The first study investigates, based on the five-factor model of personality, whether personality is expressed differently on the computer and in the internet than outside the digital environment. It is shown that the expression of the four properties extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness in the internet is significantly weaker. The expression of the property neuroticism, however, is enhanced in the sense that people on the computer and in the internet are emotionally significantly more stable than outside the digital environment. The second study assumes that narcissistic people have a special preference for online social networking. An online questionnaire study shows, however, that users of social networking sites are not generally more narcissistic than non-users. The assumption that the typical needs of narcissistic people for attention and admiration, self-disclosure and self-presentation, as well as self-esteem can be better satisfied on social networking sites than in face-to-face communication cannot be confirmed. The third study investigates whether the often reported preference of shy people for text-based, computer-mediated communication is also transferable to social networking sites. An online questionnaire study can show that the typical needs of shy people for control, belonging, and self-esteem are actually better satisfied on social networking sites than in face-to-face communication. All three studies equally demonstrate the importance of interactions between personality traits and situational aspects and, in addition, emphasize that computer-mediated communication differs significantly from face-to-face communication in some psychologically relevant aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122349-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4620308-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045242-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173865-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075995-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126710-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120814-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041248-9>
Speaking with Data : Practices, Expertises, and Visualization Modes in Data Journalism ¤ Data journalists use digital data for their reporting, which they process, visualize, and publish journalistically. Rahel Estermann works on the practice and field level, which expertises, materialities, cultures, and social processes are intertwined in data journalism. Data visualizations emerge as a common vocabulary, which enables speaking with the data in two ways: on the one hand, for the production of knowledge, and on the other hand, for presenting knowledge through data. Thus, the processes of re-hashing epistemological and professional cultures in a datafied society become visible	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135391-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131193-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070914-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028779-8>

Vehicle Drives for Electromobility: Total Cost of Ownership, Energy Efficiency, CO2 Emissions, and Customer Benefits ¤ Danny Kreyenberg presents the technological status of alternative drives and investigates the conditions for achieving ambitious cost targets for batteries and fuel cells using a new 2-factor experience curve. Furthermore, he discusses the legal and fiscal policy instruments available to the state to promote alternative drives. The author shows that their complex effect has been little investigated so far, focusing on private users in Germany. He determines their preferences when buying a mid-range passenger car using a conjoint analysis of 408 private customers. After market development and analysis of the incentive instruments, a rapid market upswing in Germany without state support seems impossible.

Atomically resolved studies of quantum excitations and interactions in low-dimensional materials ¤ This work uses a combined STM-AFM, operated at extremely low temperatures and under UHV. In the first part of this work, I investigated the structural and electronic properties of graphene on SiC(0001). The correlation between the bound surface states and the STM images was investigated. In the next part, these surface states were suppressed by Li intercalation of graphene on SiC(0001). The intercalation is discovered by quenching the characteristic superstructure of graphene and further electron doping. The Li atoms are usually placed at the lower surface: SiC buffer layer. In the next part of this study, a further Li intercalation of graphene is performed to saturate both underlying surfaces. Although the predicted superconducting phase was missing, interesting features were found in the inelastic tunnel spectra. In further investigations, single chemical bonds and electrostatic effects in the connection points of the previous samples were evaluated. For this purpose, an AFM is used to form and break a bond between the Au atom, which closes the AFM tip, and a C atom of graphene on SiC(0001) in a controlled manner. In the last part of this dissertation, I investigated the system Fe-Pb(111) using STM. Mainly two different material classes were discovered through their electronic and structural properties. The broad asymmetric gap around the Fermi energy is attributed to the strongly strained first deposited Fe layer, which grows pseudomorphically on the Pb(111) substrate. This material class suppresses the superconducting properties of the substrate. In contrast, the other material group shows metallic properties with YSR bands inside the island region.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184140-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274473-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161633-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7591667-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252995-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196755-0>

C-Arylglycosides and Chalcones: New Paths to Heterocyclic Drugs through Ru- and Pd-Catalyzed Reactions ¤ In the ongoing era of scientific medicine, a broad spectrum of drugs has been compiled for the treatment of various diseases. Nevertheless, organic synthesis chemistry has made it its task to expand this spectrum on new or known ways and for various reasons. On the one hand, the occurrence of certain compounds in nature is often limited, so that synthetic methods increasingly take the place of a less sustainable degradation. On the other hand, the physiological effect or bioavailability of a drug can be increased through derivatization and drug adaptation. In this work, some representatives of the known drug classes C-Arylglycosides and Chalcones were synthesized through the key step of the palladium-catalyzed MATSUDA-HECK reaction. For the case of C-Arylglycosides, unsaturated carbohydrates (glycals) were first represented through a ruthenium-catalyzed cyclization reaction. These were then brought into reaction with differently substituted diazonium salts in the aforementioned palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction.

Participatory governance in the Europe of cross-border regions : cooperation - boundaries - civil society ¤ This policy analysis examines geopolitical and sociocultural bordering practices in Europe’s cross-border regions and their impact on civil society participation and governance in state peripheries. The normative hope of democratisation and the legitimisation of European politics in European Union border regions are connected with a greater degree of cross-border citizen engagement in Euroregional institutions and politics. Using the example of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, this study analyses and compares four cross-border Euroregional case studies: Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino, Galicia–North Portugal, SaarMoselle and the planned German–Polish TransOderana EGTC.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021993-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7668631-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008767-0>
Student-Centered Learning in Mathematics Classrooms with Computer Algebra Systems: An Empirical Study of CAS Introduction in Thuringian Schools with Upper Secondary Level ¤ In the school year 2011/2012, the mathematics class for Thuringian students underwent a significant change. With the start of this school year, computer algebra systems (CAS) were compulsorily introduced at all Thuringian schools with upper secondary level. From grade 9 onwards, students now work with these systems in mathematics and natural sciences classes. The aim of the present study is to document the increase in student-centered learning in the classroom, which has been proven in various studies to be motivated by the introduction of CAS, under the specific Thuringian framework conditions. In contrast to previous studies on CAS, the Thuringian specificity lies in the obligation to introduce the systems. The starting point for the theoretical framework of the study is a present-day didactic theory on the use of CAS in the classroom: the triad Task – Technique - Theory. Based on the theoretical framework, three hypotheses are formulated. The hypotheses are empirically tested in the framework of a longitudinal study. The study period covers two years. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are used. In order to be able to draw a more comprehensive picture of the mathematics class, the perspectives of the students and teachers are taken into account. In addition to the development of new CAS tasks, further essential results of the present study are that Thuringian teachers have recognized the potential of CAS use in mathematics classes in terms of student-centered learning and are becoming increasingly confident in handling the systems. Based on the results, conclusions can be drawn for teacher training in Thuringia. Whether the positive effects of CAS in mathematics classes will be noticeable in the broad sense can only be assessed in the following years. The results of the present study, however, are reassuring.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010449-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8>
Wer meiner Gemeinde vierzig Hadithe bewahrt ... ¤ The Forty Hadiths are of great importance for the faith and practice of Muslims from the 9th century to the present day, but have been scientifically neglected until now. For a manageable collection of selected prophetic traditions, the content of the Forty Hadiths is extremely diverse and ranges from child education and religious aspects to jihad. In Part 1, this field of study is completely re-examined on the basis of the collection of over nine hundred collections. In Part 2, the processing of the ideology of jihad is carried out on the basis of prophetic traditions from the time of the Crusades to the present day. A translation of the original texts makes the relevant Hadith material usable for interested parties outside of Islamic studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128844-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4305296-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1153832267> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4625475-4>

Cooperations in Cross-Border European Long-Distance Passenger Rail Transport: European Cartel Law and Competition Economic Application ¤ Despite the market liberalisation of long-distance international passenger rail transport in 2010, competition has hardly developed in that sector until today. Most of the international passenger rail services are still provided by railway alliances between established formerly state-owned railway companies of different European Member States. It is assumed that these railway alliances lead to a collective dominant position and therefore to a significant impediment to effective competition.This study analyzes the existing railway alliances in long-distance international passenger rail transport on the basis of today´s economic and legal frameworks and answers the question of whether the existing alliances are likely to restrict competition and thus fall under the prohibition of cartels or whether they should be exempted from such prohibition due to efficiency gains.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138547-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194363-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052371-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074590-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173910-3>
The Liberation of Dwelling: An Architectural Phenomenon of the 1920s and 1930s ¤ When Sigfried Giedion published his small book 'Befreites Wohnen' in 1929, classical modern architecture was at the height of its creative development. What was planned and realized in Europe between 1927 and 1932 revolutionized not only building technology, spatial thinking, and building aesthetics, but also conventional living concepts. Le Corbusier, Theo van Doesburg, Mies van der Rohe, and other avant-garde comrades made fascinating attempts at new building, which were fiercely contested at the time but are now admired for their innovative power and design quality. - The present book deals with the cultural phenomenon of 'liberation'. Through impressive contemporary quotes from numerous publications published on the subject, as well as through illustrative images that reflect the enthusiastic dynamics of architects, artists, and writers of the time, both scientifically, pathetically, and often amusingly, the image of a fundamental component of this period is conveyed. 'Liberation' in general should be achieved through the architectural opening of the traditional house, through the sensual and intellectual sensitization of the occupant. One wanted to create a new architecture and a 'New Man' and built the stilt house, installed the retractable glass wall, or placed a shower on the roof. - - Interesting connections between utopias of life, art theories, and contemporary rationality become visible. The villas and single-family houses of this architectural generation are at the center of the consideration - from well-known examples to a surprising variety of rarely treated or unknown designs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013843-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117674-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129921-8>
Elemental Analysis and Multivariate Statistics for the Investigation and Evaluation of the Loading State of Flowing Waters ¤ With the aim of describing and evaluating the distribution of elements in sediments, suspended matter, and filtrates of the Elbe and the development of the burden with inorganic substances in the 1990s, the Elbe was sampled in several campaigns throughout its entire longitudinal profile and analyzed for over 60 elements of the periodic table. By evaluating the data material with two- and multi-way principal component analyses, the elements relevant for anthropogenic and geogenic characterization of the river were selected, as well as typical longitudinal profiles of the relevant elements were summarized. Sampling points with similar element distribution were combined into characteristic Elbe sections using hierarchical cluster analyses. By comparing the average section concentrations, the temporal development of the element burden could be quantified. Using two- and three-way PLS regression models, element contents in one compartment could be predicted from measured concentrations in one or two other compartments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040708-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179311-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056593-2>
Field emission scanning probe lithography on molecular resist ¤ The lithographic structure creation in the single-nanometer range represents one of the most critical technological bottlenecks in nanofabrication. As an alternative method to established electron beam lithography (EBL), in this work, illumination with low-energy electrons (<100eV) has been investigated. In this process, a Fowler-Nordheim field emission process is utilized at the apex of a scanning probe to trigger lithographically usable reactions in molecular resist systems. The unique combination of properties: (1) active scanning probes, which allow for direct imaging feedback; (2) the direct application of electrons with energies close to the lithographically relevant excitations, which enable a more efficient and spatially limited exposure process under normal environmental conditions; and (3) molecular (glass) resist systems, e.g. calixarenes, which represent a well-defined monodisperse system with low molecular weight, offers new promising possibilities. Within the scope of this work, a comprehensive picture of the complex interrelated interactions and reactions has been developed for the first time. In this context, the lithographically usable phenomena have been experimentally investigated as a function of exposure parameters, conditions, and resist material, as well as described by models and simulations. As a result of the changed exposure conditions in field emission scanning probe lithography (FE-SPL), it has been shown for the first time that (i) illumination with low-energy electrons in this resist type enables higher sensitivity and resolution, (ii) proximity effects are effectively suppressed, and (iii) new reaction types, e.g. in the form of direct removal of resist material, are triggerable. In this context, both maskless writing in the negative in the form of cross-linking and in the positive 'tone' in the form of an ablative reaction are possible. Furthermore, the overlap of both reaction types shows new self-aligned structure forms. The lithographic structure creation in the range of sub-5nm single lines, 8nm single points, and 7nm hp dense structures has been shown. Aspects regarding applicability, throughput, and structure transfer have been investigated and solved by corresponding strategies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153913-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151897-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166710-4>
The Constitutional Protection of Habilitation by Art. 5 Abs. 3 S. 1 GG: Can the Legislature Abolish Habilitation? ¤ The work deals with the question raised by the introduction of the junior professorship about the constitutional protection of habilitation by Art. 5 III 1 GG. The focus is on the objective content of the right of Art. 5 III 1 GG. It is fundamentally discussed whether Art. 5 III 1 GG contains an institutional guarantee of academic self-government and whether the matter of habilitation is to be assigned to the core area of academic self-government. Furthermore, the importance of the value-determining principle norm contained in Art. 5 III 1 GG for the protection of habilitation is examined. In this, a distinction is made between habilitation in its function as a prerequisite for appointment as a professor on the one hand and as a qualification procedure for young scientists on the other hand.

Rayleigh-Taylor instability for the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension in cylindrical domains ¤ The present thesis is concerned with the dynamic behaviour of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in a cylindrical container, e.g. a capillary, which are separated by a sharp interface. In case that the heavier fluid overlies the lighter fluid one expects that the heavier fluid sacks down into the lighter one. This effect is known as the Rayleigh-Taylor-Instability. The main result yields the existence of a critical surface tension with the following property. In case that the surface tension of the interface between the two fluids is smaller than the critical surface tension, one has Rayleigh-Taylor-Instability. On the contrary, if the interface has a greater surface tension than the critical value, the instability effect does not occur and one has exponential stability of the interface. The last part of this thesis is concerned with the bifurcation of nontrivial equilibria in multiple eigenvalues. The Invariance of the bifurcation equation with respect to rotations and reflections yields the existence of bifurcating subcritical equilibria. Finally it is proven that the bifurcating equilibria are unstable. two-phase flows; Navier-Stokes equations; surface tension; free boundary problem; Rayleigh-Taylor instability; contact angle; maximal regularity; stability; bifurcation; multiple eigenvalue	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139720-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269049-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017621-6>

Platte is not equal to Platte : Cooperation and Competition between the GDR and Poland in the Housing Industry of the 1970s ¤ The study is dedicated to the cooperation between the GDR and the People's Republic of Poland in the industrial housing industry of the 1970s. Using the example of the Polish housing series W-70 ("Warszawa 1970") and the GDR's own WBS 70, successful and unsuccessful aspects of this cooperation between the two socialist states are highlighted. The analysis includes structures, contacts, and areas of action on ministerial, institutional, and individual levels. Was there mutual influence? What role did the West play? Beyond all stereotypical notions of one-dimensional decision-making processes in state socialist systems, a history of European idea transfer and knowledge circulation in post-war modernity is told.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8>
Cloud computing - Challenges to the Legal Framework for Data Protection ¤ Cloud Computing stands for the flexible, dynamic, scalable and demand-oriented offering, use and billing of infrastructure and application components over the Internet »as a service«. The various opportunities and advantages of Cloud Computing, however, meet a legal framework that has not yet conceptually taken into account the special features (global) distributed, multi-tenant capable and virtualized IT infrastructures. The central challenges of Cloud Computing to the legal framework for data protection are discussed on the basis of the BDSG and the developments in the context of the EU data protection reform in a practical and typical field of tension. In focus are the applicable data protection law, the personal reference of data, data and information security as well as commissioned data processing. Since global data streams form the technical backbone of a globalized world economy, a focus is also placed on international data transfers – for reasons of practical relevance especially to the USA on the basis of the »Safe-Harbor-Agreement«.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>
Auflösung und Ausscheiden einzelner Gesellschafter bei Rechtsanwaltssozietäten : a corporate and professional law investigation ¤ The dissolution of a law firm partnership as well as the withdrawal of individual partners causes significant complications in practice. Not least because law firms are characterized by a special, personal performance and thus also a special asset structure. The author systematizes and analyzes the corporate and professional law issues, from the dissolution of the company and the voluntary or forced withdrawal of individual partners to settlement agreements and anti-competitive measures up to the legal position of partners without capital contribution. De lege ferenda, the upcoming reform of the law firm partnership law and the law to modernize the partnership law are also integrated into the investigation and their effects analyzed. Finally, the author sketches additional draft laws to promote the coherent revision of both matters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193468-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124552-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322766-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020616-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125969-5>
Combustion Processes for the Implementation of Biogas in Medium-Sized Industrial Engines - A 3D-CFD Combustion Process Study on Pre-Chamber, Micro-Pilot, and Direct Ignition ¤ The combustion of biogas in industrial engines poses a particular challenge even at cylinder displacements of only 2 liters. Due to the relatively low laminar flame speed of this special gas, it leads to slow combustion with corresponding disadvantages in engine efficiency and emissions. Within the scope of this work, three combustion processes are considered: direct ignition, ignition enhancement through pre-chamber washing, and micro-pilot ignition. Using 3D-CFD combustion calculations, a spatially resolved and time-dependent insight into these combustion processes in the context of biogas combustion can be given. For this purpose, 0D/1D motor process and charge exchange models were built, which provided the boundary conditions for the 3D-CFD simulations (RANS). The models were validated using measurements on the engine test stand for all three combustion processes. High-pressure indication measurements were available for each of the six cylinders. For the 3D-CFD combustion calculation, the laminar flame speed is required. To work with reliable values for biogas in the operating range of modern pre-chamber gas engines, reaction kinetic calculations were performed. With a specially written script, a high result quality was achieved, along with reliable convergence of the calculations. The validation of these calculations was carried out using literature values. The resulting data basis served as a basis to derive a new correlation for determining the laminar flame speed and to implement it in the 3D-CFD tool. This correlation represents the dependence on temperature, pressure, air-fuel ratio, carbon dioxide content in the biogas, and residual gas content in a very wide operating range. Due to its compact design, it can be used problem-free in other 3D-CFD tools and for predictive engine process calculation in the future. The 3D-CFD results calculated using the new correlation were validated using engine test stand measurements. This makes a comparison of the combustion processes with each other legitimate. In this way, an insight into flame spread and nitric oxide formation is given, as well as locations with high concentrations of unburned fuel are localized. With this, a new depth of information is available for the investigation of the three combustion processes at only 2 liters of cylinder displacement with biogas as a special fuel. Based on these results, a new pre-chamber prototype was manufactured and measured on the engine test stand using pre-chamber pressure indication. This makes it possible to evaluate the predictability of the 3D-CFD calculations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062661-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130358-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006796-8>
Robust peer prediction mechanisms ¤ Zusammenfassung: This thesis addresses the challenge of peer prediction, which seeks to elicit private information from rational agents without the requirement that ground truth is eventually revealed. The classical peer prediction method provides a solution to the peer prediction challenge. It compares the reported information of an agent with the reported information of another agent, and computes a payment rule that implements truth revelation in a strategic equilibrium. However, the algorithm computing the payments critically depends on the method's assumption that all agents share the same prior beliefs and that the algorithm ("mechanism") knows these beliefs.In this thesis, I relax this common knowledge assumption. I first design the "Robust Bayesian Truth Serum" (RBTS), which asks agents for two types of reports, the report of the private information it is interested in and a prediction report corresponding to an agent's belief about the private information of other agents. RBTS dispenses with the assumption that the agents' prior beliefs need to be known to compute the payments. It does, however, still rely on the agents sharing the same prior beliefs. My second contribution is the design of subjective-prior peer prediction mechanisms, which further reduce the assumption of common knowledge. As in RBTS, they do not require knowledge of the agents' prior beliefs. Moreover, they allow the agents' prior beliefs to be subjective, i.e. different from one another. My third contribution is the study of effort-incentivizing peer prediction. In many applications of interest, the information that seeks to be elicited first needs to be acquired. When this information acquisition requires costly effort, agents may have an incentive to avoid it and choose to guess instead. Addressing this problem, I suggest payments, where only agents with good enough information have an incentive to participate in the mechanism. Agents not investing effort and agents with low quality, choose to pass, effectively self-selecting according to quality	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144220-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Success Factors in Small Service Companies: An Analysis Using the Example of the Gastronomy ¤ BEGIN: Theoretical Foundations -- The Gastronomy Industry -- Theoretical Model and Hypothesis Formation -- Empirical Investigation -- Research Results -- Discussion and Evaluation. Due to the ongoing development of the business environment, the permanent adaptability of companies has become a prerequisite for their long-term existence. Especially in industries with less growth potential, companies must develop strategies to achieve competitive advantages. Christine R. Schneider investigates the question of success factors in the gastronomy industry from the perspective of industrial economics theory, resource-based theory, and entrepreneurship theory, with special consideration of the human and social capital of the entrepreneur. Based on a perspective of strategic management and entrepreneurship, the author develops and tests a theoretical model within a quantitative study of St. Gallen gastronomy companies. The author identifies the entrepreneur, a differentiation strategy, and the achievement of virtual rents as critical success factors in small service companies.

Carbon-based Nanofillers for Olefin Block Copolymer and Multilayer Composites ¤ BEGIN Abstract: One of the goals of this work was to investigate the reinforcement effect of carbon fillers in olefin block copolymers. Initially, the effect of different filler contents of thermally reduced graphite oxide (TRGO), which was reduced at 750 °C, on the property profile was investigated. It was found that in a TRGO 750/OBC composite with a filler content of 2.5 wt%, a reinforcement effect was observed in all mechanical properties (tensile stress at 100% elongation (F100) +10 %, maximum tensile strength (Fmax) +24 %, elongation at break (εmax) +12 %, Shore A hardness +6 %). Further increase of the filler content leads to an increase in F100 and Shore A hardness, but also to a strong decrease in εmax and Fmax. The barrier effect of the composite against oxygen increases steadily with the filler content up to a reduction of 76% at 20 wt%. The reduction per weight fraction of filler is, however, highest at 13% at 2.5 wt% TRGO 750. The significant reduction of εmax at filler contents above 7.5 wt% is, considering the potential application areas of a thermoplastic elastomer like OBC, an exclusion criterion. Therefore, a comparison of carbon fillers of different functionalization and morphology was carried out at a filler content of 2.5 wt%. It was found that functionalized fillers showed greater reinforcement effects than non-functionalized fillers at Fmax, F100, and Shore hardness. The functionalization had no effect on the barrier effect against oxygen. A comparison of the functionalized fillers showed that fillers with a plate-like morphology (pM) showed different reinforcement effects than fillers with a spherical morphology (sM). (Fmax pM: +26 %, sM:+17 %, F100: pM: +15 %, sM: +4 %, εmax: pM: +3%, sM: +15%, Shore hardness: pM: +7%, sM: -6 %, barrier effect: pM: +27 %, sM:+1 %). This can be attributed to a higher aspect ratio and the resulting better bonding to the matrix. Functionalized plate-like fillers showed the greatest reinforcement effect. The second goal of this work was the production of carbon/multilayer composites. Two production methods were investigated. On the one hand, the production of the graphite ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010542-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768127-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7591667-8>
The Right to Social Protection after the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Implementation in Uganda and Ghana ¤ ‚Disability may increase the risk of poverty; poverty may increase the risk of disability’. Die Durchbrechung dieses Kreislaufes stellt für die Staatengemeinschaft eine große Herausforderung dar, insbesondere jedoch für die Länder des globalen Südens. Als jüngstes Menschenrechtsabkommen der Vereinten Nationen konkretisiert die VN Behindertenrechtskonvention auch das Recht auf soziale Sicherung. Diese Studie beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, inwieweit sich aus den konkreten Umsetzungspflichten ein menschenrechtsbasierter Ansatz ableiten lässt, der durch Bedarfsorientierung und Barrierefreiheit geprägt ist. Des Weiteren wird ein Blick auf die Implementierungsbemühungen in Subsahara-Afrika geworfen. Hierbei wird aufgezeigt, wie es in den Beispielländern Uganda und Ghana teilweise gelungen ist, innovative Konzepte zu entwickeln, die die Realitäten des Lebens von Menschen mit Behinderungen vor Ort abbilden und gleichzeitig die Umsetzung völkerrechtlicher Pflichten ermöglichen. ‘Disability may increase the risk of poverty, and poverty may increase the risk of disability.’ Breaking this cycle is a major challenge for the international community, especially the countries of the Global South. As the most recent human rights treaty of the United Nations, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also specifies the right to social protection. This study deals with the question of to what extent a human rights-based approach characterised by need orientation and accessibility can be derived from specific state obligations. In addition, it examines the efforts to implement such an approach in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, the study shows that it has been possible to both develop innovative concepts that consider the realities of the lives of local people with disabilities in Uganda and Ghana and, at the same time, to ensure the implementation of international human rights law in those two countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069235-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055732-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7>

The Complexity of Political Action: The Liberalism-Communitarianism Debate in the Light of Hannah Arendt's Thought ¤ Introduction-- Chapter I: Political Freedom: From Concept to Experience -- Chapter II: The Political World -- Chapter III: Political Action -- Chapter IV: Political Judgment -- Conclusion -- Bibliography and Abbreviations -- About this Book -- About the Author Starting from the phenomenological results of Hannah Arendt's works and their further development, the Liberalism-Communitarianism debate is expanded and founded in a phenomenological perspective on the situation of the political community. The debate is limited to the direct confrontation of some communitarians with John Rawls' theory of justice. The interdependence of action and political world - a central thought of Hannah Arendt, which guides the investigation - is the field for the recovery of the concrete dimension of political action. The starting point is political freedom, as it appears in everyday experiences and thus becomes experiential. In the course of the presentation, the features of action in the sense of Hannah Arendt are repeatedly confronted with the intentions of non-phenomenological authors, where it becomes clear to what extent they see or miss the phenomena of action and the experientiality of political freedom. The theatrical character of action, the question of being and appearance, and the aesthetics of lying lead to an original description of judgment following Hannah Arendt, which appears in the interdependence of action and political world and in confrontation with Kant's relevant paragraphs from the Critique of Judgment. Continuing Arendt's approaches, the author shows that Hannah Arendt would have attributed a political character to judgment if she had come to the execution of her thoughts on judgment. The examination of the phenomena of action and the various possibilities of judgment reveals previously unseen relationships. It can also be fruitfully used for the formation of political consciousness, which is concretized in the formulation of specific tasks and demands.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128597-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115590-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033229-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035582-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128337-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313395-2>
Development of new catalysts of group 4 for the hydroamination and hydroamination alkylation of alkenes and alkynes ¤ Within the scope of this work, new ligands for group 4 metal complexes were synthesized, which are used in hydroamination and hydroamination alkylation of alkenes and alkynes. The metal complexes were used in the alken- and alkin-hydroamination. As a ligand class, ß-Enaminone were synthesized. Various crystal structures of these metal complexes could be determined with the help of X-ray structure analysis. After modification of some ß-Enaminone, further ligands could be obtained. A catalyst system was developed, which enables the alkin-hydroamination. In this case, the Zr-catalyst was converted with sulfonamides. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of the complex [Cp2Zr(NMe2)2] was further investigated. In cooperation with the Beckhaus working group, further metal complexes were tested for their activity. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217435-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190943-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140648-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2>
Ar@chitekturen in Celluloid : The Cinematic View of Space ¤ When it comes to the topic of architecture and film, one initially associates it with sets or set design, thinks of films like »Metropolis« or »Blade Runner«. This book offers a new perspective: It shows how film designs spaces, evokes emotions, and lets the viewer immerse themselves in an illusionary space. This knowledge is also of great interest for architectural space design. Filmic space concepts such as editing or framing are considered from the perspective of architecture and discussed from a perception-theoretical point of view. Theoretical approaches and exemplary case studies create an intermedial interface that generates a new understanding of the emergence of spatial effects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048561-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>

Contested Statehood : Palestine between Occupation, Development, and Political Islam ¤ Helmut Krieger examines the state formation process in the occupied Palestinian territories from a political economy perspective. The Palestinian Authority is analyzed as a strategic terrain where cooperation, conflicts, and struggles between the Israeli occupation power, Western development agencies, and Palestinian organizations are condensed. This reveals how state formation in Palestine is fundamentally contested, dependent, and neoliberal-shaped, and shaped by multiple crisis dynamics. Rather than reiterating the much-vaunted intractability of the Middle East conflict, this book presents a complex account of responsibility for the status quo.

The Administration of History: Monument Conservation and the State in Germany 1871 - 1933 ¤ Dealing with the past, shaping the present The remnants of the past do not preserve themselves. Their preservation is the task of monument conservation. But what exactly is monument conservation? What does it do, who is responsible for it? Is it really necessary? Why do we strive to preserve and maintain what has been taken over from the past? Winfried Speitkamp follows how monument conservation has established itself as a public task and a state institution. This happened in the decades between the founding of the Empire and the end of the Weimar Republic. Initially, it was limited to individual, particularly significant monuments, but it had established itself comprehensively by the end. It was then scientifically conducted, bureaucratically organized, and legally legitimized, but it also had to face public criticism. At the beginning of this development, civilizational criticism and the homeland protection movement played an equally important role as urban planning and monument theory. Next, the state's access to monuments and monument conservation will be examined in detail, and then the social conflicts that are inevitably associated with monument conservation will be in the spotlight. A classic conflict area, for example, is the tension between private property and the common good. The investigation includes a lot: intellectual history and administrative history, urban planning, architectural and art history, building law and monument protection laws. All this belongs to monument conservation and its two faces - dealing with the past and shaping the present. Content of the book: Introduction: Monument Conservation and the State. I.

Gas investigations in muddy sediments ¤ The formation of gas in the seafloor, especially in supersaturated concentrations, can lead to a change in the acoustic properties of marine sediments. This phenomenon is also known as the basin effect. The gases can prevent the investigation of sediment layers with flat seismic systems. Therefore, the concentration of methane and its saturation limits were to be investigated. The possibly present bubbles should be analyzed with regard to their size and distribution in the sediment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292811-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134766-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179738-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019320-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169678-5>

On the complexity of modified instances ¤ This dissertation investigates the complexity of modified instances and to what extent NP-complete problems behave stably under minimal change. We consider for various NP-complete problems whether knowledge of a solution to an instance can provide help in deciding a slightly modified instance. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent modified instances can be decided efficiently if not only a solution of the unmodified instance is given, but more general hints, such as a polynomially long string. This question plays a major role not only everywhere where NP-complete problems need to be solved quickly in dynamic situations, but also provides deeper insights into the general nature of the class of NP-complete problems. Moreover, we consider the problem of reoptimization. That is, we investigate for various optimization problems whether one can find a good solution for modified instances of an optimization problem if an optimal solution of a similar instance is already known.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138229-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120591-1>
Mode of Transport Choice in Goods Transport: An Analysis of Regulatory and Price Policy Measures; with 64 Tables ¤ The book explains, based on a broad survey, the decision-making behavior regarding the mode of transport choice in goods transport. Since, due to a strongly increasing transport demand in goods transport, external costs are caused in considerable extent, transport policy must take targeted measures to make this additional demand as environmentally friendly as possible. Therefore, the EU and the federal government strive for the goal of traffic diversion from the road to alternative modes of transport. This work analyzes which determinants the mode of transport choice of shippers depends on, in order to be able to determine the effect of certain regulations subsequently. For example, the impact of the truck toll on the mode of transport choice is examined. To determine the determinants, a discrete decision model is econometrically estimated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187820-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113446-1>
Population and molecular genetic analyses of persistent right aortic arch and primary cataracts in the German Pinscher ¤ German Pinscher, Cataract, Heritability. - The German Pinscher is an ancient dog breed that shares common roots with the Dobermann Pinscher, the Miniature Pinscher, the Affenpinscher, the Miniature Schnauzer, the Standard Schnauzer, and the Giant Schnauzer. The first depictions of the breed can be found in a book from 1884. In the middle of the 20th century, the breed was severely depleted due to the consequences of the two World Wars and had to be completely rebuilt. This task was taken over by Werner Jung, who searched the country for the few remaining, possibly breed-typical Pinschers and crossed them with four particularly large Miniature Pinschers. Most German Pinschers today are descendants of these few dogs. As a result, the modern German Pinscher has a relatively small gene pool, a fact that requires special attention in the context of possible breed-specific diseases. The increasing knowledge of the prevalence and pathogenesis of eye and heart diseases within this breed requires an adjustment and development of breeding guidelines to reduce the occurrence of these likely hereditary diseases as much as possible. Therefore, it is of particular importance to understand the population genetic and molecular genetic backgrounds of persistent right aortic arches and primary cataracts in the German Pinscher to optimize the breeding of dogs with these characteristics and improve the health of the breed. The results of this study will contribute to improving breeding practices in the German Pinscher and securing the health of the breed in the long term.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152594-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236160-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158095-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216352-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024663-2>
Identification and functional characterization of idessuis, the immunoglobulin M-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus suis. ¤ Streptococcus suis, IgM, Complement. - Streptococcus (S.) suis is an important invasive, extracellular pathogen of pigs, which mainly causes meningitis, arthritis, and serositis. Furthermore, S. suis is an important zoonotic pathogen that mainly causes meningitis in humans. In Europe, no vaccine against S. suis infections has been licensed so far. S. suis infections occur frequently 6-10 weeks post partum. At this time, piglets usually have high S. suis-specific IgM titers. The present work was initiated by the detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-cleavage products in the supernatant of serum-opsonized S. suis. IgM is the first antibody class produced after stimulation with an antigen and represents the main class of natural antibodies. It has important functions including the neutralization of pathogens/toxins, the activation of the classical complement pathway (CP), and the enhancement of humoral immune responses. The present work was designed to investigate the pathogenesis of S. suis infections in piglets during the early adaptive immune response. The objectives consisted of the identification and characterization of the IgM-cleaving factor of S. suis (Chapter 3). After successful identification of IdeSsuis, the immunoglobulin M-cleaving enzyme, the hypothesis was investigated that IdeSsuis is involved in the complement evasion of S. suis (Chapter 4). Finally, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant (r) IdeSsuis vaccine were determined (Chapter 5). Sequence comparisons showed that S. suis has a gene that exhibits large homologies to the IgG-cleaving enzyme of S. pyogenes (IdeS). By functional analysis, it was proven that rIdeSsuis has a specific IgM-proteolytic activity but does not cleave IgG and IgA. Loss and gain of function experiments showed using various isogenic S. suis- and Lactococcus (L.) lactis-mutants that the expression of IdeSsuis is responsible and sufficient for the cleavage of IgM. Furthermore, it was shown that the binding of IgM to the surface of S. suis is modulated by the expression of IdeSsuis. Western Blot analyses proved that IdeSsuis exclusively cleaves porcine IgM, but not the IgM of six other investigated species. By N-terminal Edman sequencing, the cleavage site in the IgM molecule in the N-terminal region of the constant domain 3 (Cμ3) was identified. Since the C1q-binding motif is located in Cμ3 and is separated from the Fab region by the IdeSsuis-mediated IgM cleavage, the hypothesis...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4819884-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047521-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115512-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161376-4>
Health Profiling of Food Brand Articles: Measurement, Determinants, and Implications ¤ Through a stronger health profiling, manufacturers and trading companies in the food industry try to secure market shares. Clemens Jüttner measures the perceived health profiling and examines relationships to determinants and success effects analytically and experimentally using a consumer survey on selected food brand articles. He shows that a stronger health profiling can increase the brand value. At the same time, consumers are also willing to pay higher prices for the corresponding food.

Proof of the Geographical Origin of Pistachios Based on the Isotopic Composition ¤ In the global pistachio trade, falsifications occur repeatedly, as Iranian pistachios are relabeled and sold as more expensive American goods or mixed with American pistachios. This not only deceives the consumer in accordance with §11 of the LFGB, but may also pose a health risk. Iranian and also Turkish pistachios must be examined for their aflatoxin content before import into the EU, as it is often too high, while American pistachios are not subject to a presentation requirement. However, the food monitoring authority currently has no method available to determine the origin of pistachios clearly and check the labeling. In this work, a discriminant model is presented, which, with the help of IRMS measurement technology, provides a clear authenticity determination of pistachios from the three main producing countries Iran, USA, and Turkey.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037882-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311048-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159598-1>
The Evolution of Song in Acrocephalinae (Hippolais, Acrocephalus and Chloropeta) Including Phylogeny and Morphological, Ecological and Social Factors ¤ The acoustic signaling is a central behavioral trait of Acrocephalinae. Their song shows an enormous diversity with significant interspecific variation. To what extent this song variation is more due to adaptive adjustments to morphological, ecological or social factors or due to the homologous development through phylogeny, is equally little investigated as the complex interaction of these factors. To investigate this question, I dissected the song according to various song characteristics, related these to the mentioned factors and then corrected the result phylogenetically. It shows an unequal influence of the factors on the song characteristics. The most important influence is phylogeny and sexual selection. Through the increased sexual function of the song in migrating Acrocephalinae, these differ in repertoire size and singing place from non-migrating species. The previously assumed relationships between body size and song frequency on the one hand and complexity and social system on the other hand disappear in the phylogenetic correction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071050-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455398-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215082-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076110-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345102-0>
Local Symmetries and Reality: A Philosophical Study of Gauge Theories and Structural Realism ¤ In the debate about scientific realism, structural realism - whose view holds that the real content of scientific theories lies in their mathematically-logical structure - is increasingly gaining importance. The present work examines this thesis in the context of the most significant class of theories in our fundamental physics, the gauge theories, which are characterized by special local symmetry structures. The work offers the reader in its first chapters an introduction to the central themes of symmetries, scientific realism, and gauge theories. In the analyses conducted in the middle part, quantum and gravitational gauge theories are examined in a conceptual sense - especially with regard to the underlying principles - and ontological sense - with a view to the underdetermination of entities and various locality assumptions - in detail. As a result, a support for structural realism emerges, however not in its radical ontological variant, but in the milder epistemological or at most intermediate variant, in which both structures and their carriers exist, with the latter, however, being amorph and thus epistemically unavailable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139710-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122125-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041408-5>
Customer Relationship Risk from a Corporate Perspective ¤ On the importance of customer relationship risk in customer value-oriented marketing -- Customer relationships: subject area and theoretical framework -- The risk from a corporate perspective -- Customer relationship risk -- Conclusion. The discussion of the risks of entrepreneurial trade has long taken a central place within business research and corporate practice. Based on value-oriented customer relationship management, Jochen Becker develops a multi-dimensional concept of customer relationship risk. He refers to existing risk concepts in financial economic literature and in controlling, whose applicability to relationship marketing he critically examines. To determine the individual risk dimensions, models are developed that enable implementation in corporate practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326109-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236865-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4776793-5>
Environmental Certificates as Economic Control Instruments and Their Effects on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Comparative Investigation of the Controllability of Land Sealing and Water Use in Germany and the USA ¤ The starting point of the treatise is the political requirement of reducing land sealing and water use in Germany. This ecological goal is implemented through the creation of an economic model for controlling land sealing and water use based on environmental certificates. Based on an empirical survey of existing environmental policy controls in the USA and Germany, as well as model-theoretical approaches in the literature, a new economic control model is developed step by step on the basis of tradable environmental certificates. The work is thus internationally and interdisciplinarily located at the interface between ecology, economics, and law. The preventive and follow-up effect of the control model is particularly important for SMEs in the context of land recycling of former business premises and for municipalities in terms of the reduction of commercial land surplus. Against this background, the control model can be seen as a suitable balance between the politically prescribed quantity limitation, the interests of SMEs and municipalities on the one hand, and the preservation of existing assets and preventive behavior on the other hand. It thus represents a contribution to sustainable development for the environmental media soil and water. With the control model for the environmental media soil and water based on environmental certificates, a mature and practical economic control instrument is available for efficient quantity control. Now, only a political decision is necessary regarding its implementation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122086-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138608-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114030-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204025-5>
Students – Students – Inclusion: Orientations on the way to differential sensitive teacher education? ¤ The implementation of inclusive school education raises questions about the professionalization of prospective teachers – here, above all, the importance of their own school- and education-related orientations is emphasized. At the same time, it is striking in the discussions about inclusion that students themselves are hardly heard. The study takes up these findings by focusing both on the target group of students and that of students and then asks how students in their understanding of inclusion refer to the perspectives of students. The documentary analysis of student orientations shows that students hardly perceive the voices of students as independent positions, but rather use them as a starting point for shaping their own prospective position in school. The results are illuminated from a praxeological perspective on teacher professionalism and provide information on which differential norms are effective and from which students distance themselves. They also draw attention to questions and requirements of inclusive teaching and research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201275-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693876-1>
Graphene - Epitaxial Growth, Characterization, and Non-Classical Electronic Device Concepts ¤ In the present dissertation, the focus points of growth on semi-insulating 6H-SiC, layer- and device characterization based on epitaxial graphene were treated. The layers were investigated using REM, AFM, LEED, XPS and ARPES. By means of REM images, the quality of the layers was correlated with the growth parameters using a new approach. For the determination of the layer thickness using XPS, (a-)symmetric fit functions and their error in determining the thickness were considered. The second focus point deals with the characterization of the produced layers by Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. The influences of strain, Fermi level and layer number on the Raman spectrum of graphene were classified and quantified. Uniaxial could be distinguished from biaxial strain by means of the difference in the G/2D dispersion, the asymmetry of the G-mode is mainly influenced by uniaxial strain, the position of the Fermi level as well as by transfer doping in the presence of adsorbates. Increasing layer number caused a blue shift of the 2D mode with increasing half-width. By means of FTIR, the change of the reststrahlen band of SiC was investigated in dependence on the growth by exciting a surface plasmon polariton in graphene. A method of evaluation was developed to describe the Fano resonance emerging in the division spectrum of the reflectivities. The intensity of the resulting Fano resonance is mainly influenced by the shift of the model oscillators relative to each other. The third focus point deals with the structuring and characterization of completely graphene-based, three-terminal junctions (TTJ) and side-gate transistors (SG-FET). For the measurement of smallest structural widths using REM images, methods for correcting oscillations and determining the width below/just below the resolution limit of the REM were derived. It could be shown that TTJs exhibit a rectification effect with high rectification efficiency. Furthermore, the occurring amplification effects were investigated. The realized SG-FETs show comparable good properties like conventional top-gate transistors at minimizing parasitic influences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152546-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135411-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055009-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151897-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131472-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7591667-8>

The structurally weak areas of the community in the run-up to EC '92: Problem situations, development trends and perspectives; an example of the Objective 1 regions of Spain and Italy ¤ The aim of the work was to make an empirical contribution to the clarification of the question of the spatial effects of the EC internal market. The subject of the investigation were the structurally weak areas of Italy, the Mezzogiorno, which includes the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, as well as the two islands of Sardinia and Sicily, and those of Spain with Andalusia, Asturias, Galicia, Castile and León, Castile-La Mancha, Valencia, Murcia, Extremadura and the Canary Islands. In Italy, these areas cover 40% of the total area and approximately 36.6% of the total population. In Spain, the share of the total area is 76.1% and approximately 58% of the population. Special attention was paid to the problem areas of "Direct Investments" and "Infrastructure", as these are the causes of the feared spatially divergent development trends. The investigation comes to the result that through the EC '92 project, spatially divergent development paths experience an additional exacerbation. The policy of the European Communities is too one-sidedly concentrated on the comprehensive deregulation concept of the EC internal market. But for this, a steering and correction mechanism must be established on a political level, in order to counteract the unwanted spatial concentrations and polarizations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145576-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129069-0>
Promoting Attention and Motivation Retention through Digital Game-Based Learning Systems with Specific Suitability for Autism ¤ Institutional education is associated with diverse and specific barriers for autistic learners. This is particularly relevant in the context of inclusion, the relevance of which is not least given by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This work discusses numerous learning-relevant peculiarities in the context of autism and shows discrepancies to the institutional teaching concepts that are not always adequately tailored. A central thesis is that the unusually intense attention of autistic individuals for their special interests can be used to facilitate learning with foreign content. Based on this, solution approaches are discussed, which result in a new concept for a digital multi-device-based learning game. A significant challenge in designing game-based learning is the adequate integration of learning content into a captivating narrative context.

Präparative and mechanistic studies on titanocatalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes ¤ Intramolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkenes were realized selectively without competing hydroamination reactions. Primary and secondary aminoalkenes could be transformed successfully into the corresponding hydroaminoalkylation products with a variety of Ti-catalysts. Secondary aliphatic amines could be successfully used for Ti-catalyzed intermolecular hydroaminoalkylations of alkenes for the first time. In this context, the successful addition of dimethylamine to alkenes deserves particular attention because a corresponding Ti-catalyzed reaction has never been reported before. Because detailed mechanistic data are not available for the hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes, an extensive kinetic investigation of the reaction of a 1-amino-6-heptene was carried out. The data obtained revealed the reaction order, the activation parameters and the rate determining step of the catalytic cycle. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217435-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223132-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001705-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001207-4>
Application of Cryogenic Calorimeters for High-Resolution Precision X-Ray Spectroscopy ¤ Within the scope of this work, the technology of metallic magnetic microcalorimeters, which has been continuously developed over the past few years, was prepared for use as a high-precision spectrometer in atomic physics. These detectors combine the advantages of various conventional energy-dispersive photon detection technologies due to their unique functional principle. They combine the broad spectral acceptance of semiconductor detectors with the high resolution of crystal spectrometers and thus represent an ideal tool for measuring atomic physical interactions with a broad range of photon energies. In order to fully exploit the potential of the detectors, however, the transition from an analog signal analysis established for conventional procedures to a digital signal analysis is required. Therefore, a powerful and comprehensive software package was developed in the course of the work to be able to evaluate the data of several experiments performed. On the one hand, X-ray transitions of barium and iron were observed and identified at the S-EBIT-I. On the other hand, the 1s-Lamb shift of Xe53+ and the 2s-Lamb shift of Xe89+ were successfully measured with microcalorimeter detectors at the internal gas jet target of the ESR storage ring of the GSI. Significant improvements could be achieved both technically and conceptually for the operation and measurement procedure, so that metallic magnetic microcalorimeters are ready for future high-precision experiments in atomic physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003423-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181260-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226529-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166502-8>
Investigations on the Protective Influence of Various Feed Additives on Gastrointestinal and Systemic Colonization with Salmonella enterica after Experimental Infection in Broilers ¤ Salmonella, Probiotics, Poultry. - The use of probiotic feed additives is an approach to reduce the entry of Salmonella into the food chain. Salmonella often do not cause clinical symptoms in broilers and infections are therefore often not recognized. Through the consumption of contaminated animal origin food, it leads to Salmonellosis in the consumer, which manifests itself in a sometimes severe enteritis. The aim of the present study was the testing of various feed additives in animal experiments with regard to the reduction of Salmonella colonization of the gut and internal organs of broilers infected with Salmonella enterica. For this purpose, five different probiotics as well as butyric acid-glyceride were tested. All preparations used in this study were previously tested in an in vitro screening procedure for their inhibitory effect against Salmonella. Before and after the chicks were infected with Salmonella at the 13th day of life, samples were taken at intervals for qualitative bacteriological examination. A quantitative bacteriological examination of liver and caecum samples took place on the 19th day of life. From the 18th to the 29th day of life, epithelial-physiological examinations were carried out using the Ussing chamber technique and the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338112-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060137-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161650-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511561-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155774-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274237-7>

Work against Poverty: Foundations, Historical Genesis, and Empirical Verification of the Poverty Trap Theory ¤ It is repeatedly claimed that social benefit recipients decide against taking up work due to lack of wage incentives and thus remain in poverty permanently (poverty trap theory). Social policy reforms increasingly rely on 'work against poverty' based on these concerns. Ronald Gebauer examines the assumption that work is the key to solving the poverty problem in modern societies in a first step historically-sociologically. In a further step, the theoretical foundations of the poverty trap theory are discussed. But how does the reality content of the poverty trap theory behave now? Most empirical studies show that social benefit receipt is predominantly of short-term nature. Based on these results, a own data evaluation of the Socio-economic Panel (Social Assistance) is presented	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201940-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142879-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114001-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055856-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127505-6>
On the Validity of the Jarzynski Equation in Quantum Systems ¤ The Jarzynski equation belongs to a series of new theorems of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is an equation that contains the second law of thermodynamics, but goes beyond it. It also brings process variables from non-equilibrium processes into a new relationship with equilibrium variables. However, there is still a question about the validity of the equation for the quantum case, especially in small systems. In contrast to classical systems, there is uncertainty here, and there are very contradictory statements that are based on different definitions and quantum-mechanical interpretations of the equation. Simple, understanding-promoting example systems were lacking so far. In this work, two such example systems are now considered and checked, how the results differ from the classical results and which of the special properties of quantum systems have an impact on the result.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023677-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047989-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130850-5>
Genome Editing in Plants: Legal Framework and Reform Options ¤ The legal regulation lags behind the actual progress in biotechnology. This affects all areas of the biotechnological transformation, especially but the biotechnological procedures of genome editing. The work focuses on genome-edited and other „innovative“ crop plants. It provides suggestions for reforming the EU's genetic engineering legal framework, but not only short- and medium-term, but also long-term, so that also reforms are discussed that currently appear to be not politically realizable. Initially, the scientific and legal starting situation for reforms of European genetic engineering law is presented. Subsequently, the framework conditions for reforms are explained, particularly the interests of those affected and the limits of what is legally permissible in Union and world trade law. Based on this, options for reforms are illuminated, taking into account regulation in non-European countries and proposals from the literature. Finally, a concrete reform of the EU's genetic engineering legal framework is proposed. The author Brigitte Voigt studied law at the University of Passau. Subsequently, she worked there in the project „Genome Editing in Plant Biotechnology“ (FKZ 01GP1615) funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. She completed her legal clerkship in the district of the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart. Part 1: Starting situation -- A. Scientific starting situation -- B.

The Process of Plasma-Supported Aluminum Sputtering and the Properties of Layers Produced Thereby ¤ This work deals with the investigation of a combination process consisting of aluminum sputtering and additional plasma support for the coating of plastic foil. A hollow cathode arc discharge is used as the plasma source. Due to the interaction of the plasma with the aluminum vapor, aluminum particles are primarily ionized by electron impact and Penning processes. Ionization causes a changed scattering behavior of the Al particles and results in a decrease in the deposition rate. At the same time, the energy input during layer formation increases due to the kinetic and recombination energy of the ions. This energy input causes changes within the growing layer, which affect various layer properties. Due to smaller grain sizes within the plasma-supported deposited layers, their electrical conductivity is reduced. Their optical properties, on the other hand, remain largely unaffected. Depending on the respective permeant, its permeation through the layers is differently affected by the plasma support. While the permeation of water vapor is hardly changed, that of oxygen is reduced by about 50%. Using a simple model of layer growth, this different effect of plasma support on permeation was investigated in more detail. It turned out that different defect sizes are decisive for the different permeants. The number of larger defects through which oxygen can permeate is effectively reduced by the plasma support. The influence on the small defects important for water vapor is, on the other hand, small. For comparison, the properties of the deposited probes were compared to those sputtered. The most important differences concern the electrical and permeation properties. Without plasma support, deposited layers show the highest electrical conductivity. Sputtered layers have similar values to those plasma-supported deposited. The permeation of gases and vapors is at least for thicker layers better prevented by the sputtered layers. For oxygen, thin layers of plasma-supported deposited probes show the lowest permeation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001573-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143379-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046249-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137838-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4849312-0>
Lobbyism and Transparency: A Comparative Study of a Complex Relationship ¤ Determinants of lobbyist transparency -- Motives of transparency creation -- Levels of transparency creation -- Regulation of transparency creation -- New perspectives for lobbying and transparency research Although the number of publications on lobbying and transparency has increased significantly, little is known about the connection between the two phenomena. The motives of transparency creation or transparency prevention by lobbyists have remained largely unexplored in scientific discussion, as well as unclear or contradictory concept understandings have made it difficult to compare and connect research results. After an intensive discussion of the definitional foundations, derived knowledge from theory and practice, as well as data from a quantitative survey with qualitative follow-up questioning, show that the connection between lobbying and transparency is much more complex than widely assumed.

Modelling primary multisensory mechanisms of spatial perception ¤ In this work, visual, auditory, and multimodal forms of spatial perception and their relevance for the design of technical systems are discussed. The scientific approach adopted here has an interdisciplinary character and considers methodological aspects of neurobiology, psychophysics, and computer science in the context of neuroinformatics and robotics. As a result, new and more comprehensive interpretations of findings on natural perception are possible. On the other hand, deficiencies of existing simulation models and technical applications are named and overcome. The starting point of the investigations is in Chapter 1 the discussion and critical evaluation of established attention models of perception, in which early multisensory brain functions are largely ignored. As a fundamental idea of the following investigations, the thesis is formulated that a conceptual separation between primary attention and higher cognitive abilities both facilitates the assignment of sensory features and neurological mechanisms as well as modeling and simulation. In Chapters 2 and 3, the primary spatial encodings of the central auditory pathway and the visual system are first presented and the specifics of projected and calculated sensory topographies are described. The subsequent modeling of auditory-visual integration mechanisms in Chapter 4 is explicitly not for classification or tracking of objects but for early spatial control of attention, which in the biological model occurs unconsciously and at subcortical level. After discussing the few known model concepts, two own multisensory simulation systems are developed on the basis of artificial neural networks and probabilistic methods. Chapter 5 is devoted to the systematic experimental investigation and optimization of the models and shows how unconscious perception performances and their simulation can be evaluated in reference to qualitative and quantitative findings on multisensory effects in the midbrain. The discussion of the model behavior in real audio-visual scenarios is intended to emphasize that the early control of attention still makes an important contribution to spatial orientation before object recognition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135740-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145167-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076536-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153178-4>

The scaenae frons of the Theater of Nysa on the Maeander ¤ Summary: Nysa, one of the most important cities of ancient Caria, lies on the road from Ayd?n (the ancient Tralleis) to Denizli, about 3 km northwest of the present-day town of Sultanhisar. The preserved building remains in the city and the inscriptions as well as the small finds indicate that Nysa was continuously inhabited from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine period. The theater of Nysa probably belonged to the basic equipment of the Hellenistic city and was rebuilt several times in the Roman imperial period.

LAMMPSCuda - a new GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations package and its application to ion-conducting glasses ¤ Computersimulations are today a fundamental part of research and development. Over the past decades, the boundaries of what can be modeled have been dramatically expanded by the continuous increase in available computing power. Due to the stagnating serial computing power of current processors, future performance gains must be achieved through parallelization. In particular, heterogeneous hardware architectures are becoming increasingly important, as they exhibit inherent advantages in terms of energy efficiency. At present, this area is dominated by systems accelerated by graphics cards. Due to their five- to tenfold energy and cost efficiency, supercomputers based on graphics cards have found rapid dissemination since their introduction in 2008. Meanwhile, three of the five fastest computers in the world derive a significant portion of their computing power from graphics cards. However, new programming approaches are necessary to efficiently utilize such systems. In this work, a new molecular dynamics code called LAMMPScuda is presented. LAMMPScuda uses graphics cards to accelerate simulations of various material classes, including biological systems, semiconductors, metals, inorganic glasses, and polymer systems. Both details of the implementation and extensive performance studies are presented. These show that LAMMPScuda can run efficiently not only on individual PCs but also on large computers with hundreds of graphics cards. In the second part of the work, LAMMPScuda is used to develop a new potential for ion-conducting glasses of the composition xLi2O-yB2O3-zSi2O4-wP2O5. As shown, the new potential, designated as BC-U, not only reproduces structural but also dynamic experimental data of various binary glasses over the entire composition range better than established potentials used for comparison. Furthermore, the so-called mixed network former effect occurs in simulations of borophosphates. With this, the BC-U potential is predestined to be used for the verification of theories of the microscopic causes of this effect.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170370-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162321-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021142-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128528-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284936-6>

Wegesysteme ¤ Wegesysteme are abstracted as graphs, so that the topological minors relation is considered as the natural containment relation of graphs. By fixing certain vertices of the topological minor in the large graph, this order relation is specialized, so that existence theorems for weg systems get a simple formulation. Three new and short proofs are given for Menger's theorem on the existence of a certain weg system. One of these proofs provides a new version of the theorem, which includes the prescribability of the start and end vertices of a non-maximal weg system for a maximal weg system, as well as a linear algorithm that can be easily implemented to find this weg system. It is shown that this version has known theorems of the transversal theory, such as Hall's marriage theorem and Ford and Fulkerson's theorem on common transversals, as special cases. Furthermore, the prescribability of the start vertices is shown for Mader's theorem on the number of independent H-paths. The new version of Menger's theorem is also used to justify a procedure by which it can be investigated whether, from certain connectivity assumptions (possibly combined with a given weg system) in a graph, the existence of a sought-after weg system follows. The procedure is constructive. Either it finds a counterexample, i.e. a graph with the given assumptions that does not contain the sought-after weg system, or it provides an algorithm that finds the sought-after weg system linearly in the number of vertices and edges of the given graph. In more detail, when a graph is entered, either a separator is found that proves that the connectivity assumption is not given, or the sought-after weg system is constructed itself. The functionality of the procedure is demonstrated by examples: Two existence theorems for circles through prescribed vertices of a given graph are derived with it.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4392068-8>
Crystalline Phases with High Thermal Expansion for Crystallizing High-Temperature Glass Tubes ¤ The motivation for this work was the optimization of the expansion behavior of joining glass ceramics for use in solid electrolyte fuel cells and high-temperature reactors, which require a high thermal expansion from room temperature to 1000 °C. For this purpose, the direction-dependent thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of various silicate and aluminate phases were investigated using high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) and dilatometry in this temperature range. The more apparatus-intensive and more difficult to evaluate HT-XRD provides the direction-dependent TECs relevant for the evaluation of the thermal expansion of a crystalline phase without the influence of mechanical effects. Both methods showed that barium silicates have the highest TECs in the entire investigated temperature range. Even higher TECs are possible if a sudden increase in thermal expansion occurs, such as in BaZn2Si2O7 at around 300 °C due to a phase transition. Based on this compound, two mixed crystal series with Zn-Mg and Zn-Co substitution were produced. In both mixed crystal series, the temperature of the phase transition increases and the relative volume change decreases with increasing substitution grade. Barium zinc silicate glasses with the same SiO2 content and varying BaO to ZnO ratio were produced. With increasing BaO content, higher TECs can be achieved. Glass powders of different grain fractions were sintered and ceramicized. The glass ceramics show larger and independent of the sintering conditions TECs with increasing BaO content. This can be attributed to the increasing share of BaSi2O5. The presence of BaZn2Si2O7 (increasing with increasing ZnO content) has a negative effect.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128683-2>
Images of Aging and Life Stages in the Adult Education Image Space: A Comparative Analysis Considering Adjacent Image Spaces ¤ In the context of the current widespread concept of 'Lifelong Learning', the human life course becomes the reference point for adult education. The term elevates 'learning' to a central reference point for human life phases in general and the phases of adult age in particular. Franziska Endreß examines the pictorial representation of aging and life stages in image documents that circulate on the internet in connection with the terms adult education, further education, and lifelong learning.

Criminal Procedure Aspects of the Penal Law Doping Prosecution ¤ BEGIN\nMain description: Jan-Frederik Kolbe deals with the criminal procedure aspects of the penal law doping prosecution. The starting point of the investigation is the prevailing opinion in the literature that the penal law anti-doping norms of the AMG are so-called 'dead law'. This thesis is initially confirmed by means of an empirical investigation conducted by the author involving all public prosecutors' offices in Germany and all justice ministries of the federal states, before the application of the penal law anti-doping provisions of the AMG in the criminal procedure is investigated under orientation at the chronological course of the criminal procedure – and here a focus on the initiation of proceedings. In this way, numerous peculiarities are shown, disputed problems are discussed, and suggestions for the revitalization of this 'dead law' are given.\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116635-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126002-8>
International Corruption and Jurisdictional Conflicts: Sanctioning Companies in the Case of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials ¤ Claudia Letzien examines the criminal liability of bribery of foreign public officials and the various sanctions that can be imposed on companies in this context, using the examples of the USA, Germany, and the UK.

How Our Feeling Has Changed : Emotions Discourses in the "BRAVO" ¤ How does a "proper", "normal", or "healthy" handling of emotions look like? Depending on the socio-historical context, the answers to this question are quite different. Manuela Beyer outlines how the concepts of feelings and emotion management have changed since the 1960s in the Federal Republic of Germany. Based on a discourse analysis of the advisory pages of the youth magazine BRAVO, the study shows how societal demands on emotion management have evolved. Beyond theses of increasing liberation or suppression of feelings, it becomes clear which new emotional practices have developed	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048476-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227561-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1062915038>
The implementation of performance-oriented systems ¤ The study at hand examines the strategic perspective of the emerging phenomenon of performance-oriented systems, e.g. car-sharing or cloud computing, in the mobility, IT, energy and chemical industries. In all four industries, firms have likewise implemented a novel system-based offering recently, which is providing the performance of their products for shared use. The existing literature that has already acknowledged the phenomenon is fragmented across different areas of expertise. The emphasis of the contributions resides on the operational level and a consistent strategic innovation management perspective is absent. Thus, the study strives to synthesize the literature into a larger perspective and provide a strategic rationale to explain the phenomenon. The study follows an iterative, interpretative approach based on the methodological foundations of Grounded Theory. The findings are based on semi-structured, qualitative interviews with executives from twenty-seven system examples from four industries, clarifying the motivation for and differences in system development. Items from the substantive concept of dynamic capabilities and the juvenile strategy of superior architectural knowledge are used in a novel approach for interpretation. Based on the compiled data, the study derives ten founding propositions that delineate the strategic characteristics of the case examples, composes a coherent framework and identifies nine initial enabling factors that illustrate the context. The research reveals that novel user preferences towards a higher elasticity of resource deployment have facilitated the system development. The examined firms have integrated downward into the use phase and explicitly met the identified demand in offering the performance of several joint resources to the user instead of selling single complements. The created value is protected through the implementation of a central platform. The governance of the platform secures three types of hidden information; the capacity, the user demand and the efficiency information. The information base in the platform determines the firm's competitive advantage, as the incentive regime of a performance-oriented system is inherently oriented towards resource efficiency. Thus, the implementing firms need to continuously develop process innovations and systematically reduce slack of the system components. The study provides managerial guidance for future system developments, contributes a novel perspective on the phenomenon and qualifies recent conceptual work on superior architectural knowledge.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Insolvency-related Duties of Directors and their Advisors after the Implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1023 and StaRUG ¤ In pre-insolvency siutations it is important for company directors and their advisors to know the scope of the directors' duties and the point in time at which the duties change. Article 19 of the directive (EU) 2019/1023 contains provisions on the directors' duties when there is a likelihood of insolvency. This doctoral thesis examines to what extent directors' duties in pre-insolvency situation will change as a result of the implementation of Art. 19 RRiL and whether the existing provisions in German law are sufficient for the implementation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233771-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191672-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078605-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021127-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4745621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4325993-5>
Optical Properties of InN and InN-based Semiconductors ¤ In this work, new ways for the experimental determination of the optical properties of InN and its In-rich alloys with GaN and AlN, as well as the interpretation of the data, are presented. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range from mid-infrared (MIR) to near-infrared (NIR) to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) has proven to be a very powerful tool for investigating the absorption-related properties of these materials. Based on a multi-layer model and including surface roughness and interface layers in the data analysis, one obtains in the first step a reliable dielectric function (DF), which reflects the fundamental optical properties of the material. The interpretation of the spectral behavior represents the second step of the studies, from which one can determine probe-dependent parameters such as the frequencies of coupled phonon-plasmon modes, the splitting between valence and conduction bands at the Fermi wavevector, or the transition energies at Van Hove singularities of the band structure. By correcting these data in view of carrier-induced bandgap renormalization and Burstein-Moss shift as well as distortion, one finally obtains the intrinsic properties of the compounds. Due to an accumulation layer of electrons at the surface, it is necessary to determine the electron concentration in the volume using infrared ellipsometry. The plasma frequency extracted from the MIR data is used for a careful determination of this electron density. Furthermore, the region of the absorption edge in InN is strongly influenced by the presence of high electron concentrations and the non-parabolicity of the conduction band. The NIR data must therefore be self-consistently analyzed (coupled with the MIR results), by calculating the imaginary part of the DF over Fermi's Golden Rule. The method achieves 0.675 eV for the fundamental bandgap of hexagonal InN at room temperature. The value for cubic InN is 80 meV lower and is 0.595 eV. By analyzing the DFs of hexagonal InGaN and InAlN alloys in the same way, one obtains the bowing parameters of the fundamental bandgaps E_A. They amount to b_A = 1.71 eV (InGaN) and b_A = 4.0 eV (InAlN). Another important result is the determination of the DF in the UV-VUV spectral range and its comparison with theoretical calculations. The theoretical results regarding the imaginary part of the DF of InN are only in very good agreement with the experimental data when electron-hole interaction (excitonic effects) is taken into account. The Coulomb correlation leads to a redshift of the absorption peaks and a redistribution of the associated oscillator strengths in contrast to the single-particle DF.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171929-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4241321-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4460230-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123887-4>
Axiomatik and Empiricism : a historical investigation into the mathematical natural philosophy from Newton to Neumann ¤ Um die klassische Newton'sche Mechanik in ihrer Zeit analysieren und untersuchen zu können, muss man sich besonders mit dem Wandel des Verhältnisses von Axiomatik und Empirie befassen.

Development and Characterization of Fluid-Mechanical Flexible Actuators at the Example of a Multifunctional Suction Gripper ¤ Fluid-mechanical flexible actuators (FNA) based on silicone are increasingly used as grippers for various objects. Due to their material-locked design, these actuators enable the integration of multiple functions on a structural level. In particular, FNA are particularly suitable for gripping tasks in clean rooms and the packaging industry in the form of closed suction grippers to reduce hygiene risks. The investigation of such suction grippers is the subject of this work. Within the framework of the work, a general classification for FNA is presented based on various applications, and developed FNA are assigned to this classification. The development of FNA is described in detail at the example of the closed suction gripper. One of the features of the closed suction gripper is that it has a membrane on the object side in contrast to open suction grippers. The membrane allows, in addition to the separation of the medium in the interior of the suction gripper from the ambient medium, also the active, time- and location-specific release of gripped objects. Another feature of the chosen example is its nonlinear spring characteristic. This leads to a motion behavior with snap-through and enables adaptation to various object positions and forms. Through model considerations and experimental investigations of selected geometry and material parameters, the possibilities of influencing the snap-through sizes are shown. The formulation of a general approach for achieving specified FNA values forms a substantial contribution to this work. Furthermore, principal solutions for the implementation of a material-coherent and flexible sensorics for FNA based on silicone are presented. The implementation of the sensorics is described at the example of the suction gripper. The possibility of deriving qualitative statements on the gripping state, object conductivity, and gripping process phases is discussed. The innovative tools, equipment, and processes necessary for the production and testing of the multifunctional suction gripper are described in the framework of the work. Through the overall view of the investigated FNA properties, nonlinear characteristic, adaptability, and sensorization, the work contributes to multifunctional FNA and the approach to their development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198914-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7619504-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214091-2>
Liability, Attribution, and Proof in Case of Initial and Subsequent Impossibility ¤ BEGIN\nMain description: Daniel Peres deals with problem areas at the interface between material law and civil procedure law, which have not been provided with a satisfactory solution even ten years after the reform of the law of obligations. While as much attention has been paid to the liability elements of impossibility liability as has been paid, there is little literature that explicitly deals with the respective attribution elements and the individual proof requirements. These questions are treated equally as the difficult proof of negative, internal facts (§ 311a para. 2 BGB) or the high requirements for the proof of exoneration in impossibility liability. The solution approach takes into account the limits set by material law and evidence law dogmatics for the modification of proof requirements. It integrates the changes to the regulations on procedural leadership and the partial expansion of the parties' intra-procedural participation obligations in the course of the ZPO reform.\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186942-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4>

Hydrophobins : investigation and control of structure formation in amphiphilic fungal proteins ¤ In this thesis the influence of constraints on the formation of supramolecular structures of small amphiphilic fungal proteins called Hydrophobins is studied at the air/water interface and in phospholipid liposomes. Two hydrophobins known to form different primary aggregates at interfaces are subjected to multiple cycles of areal constraint and relief at the air/water interface and the superstructures investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after transfer to mica. The effects on both proteins are compared and contextualized with their known aggregation behaviour. Moreover, their interaction with liposomes is investigated using EPR spectroscopy, revealing fundamental differences between the two proteins that can be explained by their known aggregation tendencies in solutions. It is proposed that specific interactions can be forced to tailor interfacial structures on a micrometer scale. The interactions with liposomes give insight into the role of pre-assembly on interfacial structures and interactions with complex systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4647604-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046076-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122262-3>
Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Poly(arylenethinylen) Copolymers ¤ In the last few decades, interest in p-conjugated polymers has steadily increased due to their optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties. As materials for electronic and optical components, increased research has been conducted in academic and industrial research laboratories. In the class of conjugated polymers, Poly(para-phenylenvinylen) (PPV) has established itself alongside Poly-acetylen (PA), Poly(diacetylen) (PDA), Poly(para-phenylen) (PPP), and Poly-(arylenethinylen) (PAE). Furthermore, polymers with linear conjugated p-bonds exhibit interesting effects in electroluminescence, photoluminescence, and nonlinear optics, whose application possibilities are reflected in materials science. These are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), polymer lasers, as photoreceptors or as optical switching elements. It is worth noting that this type of polymer can be used in various areas of inorganic semiconductor technology. PPVs and their derivatives possess, in addition to strong photoluminescence (important for electroluminescence (EL)), easy electron polarizability (important for nonlinear optics (NLO)), easy charge carrier generation, and high charge carrier mobility (important for photoreceptor properties and EL) in the electric field, as well as film-forming properties. Due to these properties, PPVs have been and are of great importance in the development of polymer solar cells and as active components in organic polymer LEDs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236284-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4771604-6>
Process capability evaluation of quality under consideration of characteristic dependencies: illustrated by an example of a fastening screw ¤ Process capability indices, also known as PFIs, have been an indispensable tool for quality assurance in customer-supplier interactions and accompanying product control in mass production for a long time. These key figures are based on a very simple statistics. They provide information for each design feature about whether the manufacturing process used is capable of producing a part within the required tolerance zones or not. In the case of complete independence of product characteristics from each other, the statements of the well-known PFI formulas are correct. However, the product quality is determined in the majority of cases by the interactions and relationships of its individual parameters. Many constructions set this functionally optimized and cost-saving. Notably, the Maximum Material Condition (MMC) is particularly worth mentioning. It allows the value of the unused tolerance of a feature, for example, the diameter, to be added to other measurements, for example, position, etc. However, such positive properties can not be taken into account by today's statistical quality assurance in the sense of a key figure. This leads to the sad fact that functional parts are still scrapped. Furthermore, superpositions of properties at the parts are known, which can lead to a functional impairment. In this case, the customer receives a non-functional product, although sufficient large PFIs per feature have been proven. The resulting consideration was: to consider the interaction effects in the quality proof by adapting possibly a change in the key figures. By adopting the definition principles of current PFIs, it has been possible to conceive a single index, here referred to as Function Achievement Degree (FAD), for the fulfillment grade of the function of a product part. As an example for the practical examination of the theoretically developed formulas, the commercially available hexagon screw served. On the one hand, this part is still conventionally examined by the teaching methods due to the strong dependence of the parameters such as flank diameter, angle and partial angle. However, due to the lack of depth of statement and the high number of parts to be tested, such a type of examination should be avoided in modern quality assurance in the future. On the other hand, this mass product has a challenging package of form and position tolerances under consideration of the latest standard developments. This makes a more economical production and as a consequence cheaper parts for the customer possible without changing the manufacturing process, without acquiring special measuring instruments, and, what is particularly important, without any functional loss. This potential has been recognized in some sources, but only this work makes it possible to exploit it. The approach presented here is applicable to all common tolerance types in construction and allows not only parameters of a kind, e.g. geometric dimensions, but also all necessary sizes for the functioning of the part to be included in the capability proof.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4553619-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053256-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060356-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159653-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144198-9>
Representation of Blood Vessels on the Hind Flipper of the European Seal (Phoca vitulina vitulina) and Description and Testing of a Minimally Invasive Blood Sampling Location ¤ Seals, Veins, Blood Sampling. - The location on the hind flipper of the seal (Phoca vitulina vitulina) for blood sampling and its success rate is described differently in the literature. The goal of this work was to re-evaluate the blood vessel course on the hind flipper and, with the help of this knowledge, to describe a suitable location for a vessel puncture on the hind flipper that can be used in medical training without fixation or sedation of the seals. In the present work, the blood vessel course of the hind flipper was investigated in 22 seals and five bearded seals (Halichoerus grypus). In addition to a native macroscopically-anatomical examination, the vessels were depicted with various contrast agents (Xenetix® 350, Barium sulfate and colored latex, as well as a mixture of Barium sulfate, color and latex). Furthermore, CT angiographies were made. The arteries could be enriched with contrast medium up to the skin vessels, whereas only the main vessels could be filled with contrast medium in the veins. The enriched venous vessels ran on the plantar flipper side and mostly in parallel to the bone. At the level of the Ossa tarsi/metatasalia, the plantar plexus could be depicted with various branches and tributaries. In addition, some veno-venous anastomoses were shown. A difference in the course of the veins on the hind flipper between seal and bearded seal could not be observed. CT angiography proved to be the most accurate representation of the vascular topography. Vascular-like structures could be depicted in all seal species using ultrasound, whereas a blood flow using Doppler could only be detected in 44.4% of the seals and 71.4% of the bearded seals. Considering all the knowledge gained, the plantar plexus, which extends over the easily palpable tuber calcanei, could be identified as a suitable location for blood sampling. Subsequently, this location was tested for its practicability. In 58 attempts, a minimum volume of 0.5 ml could be obtained in 29.3%. The method is complication-free, easy to learn, and can be performed in trained animals without coercive measures. This method can therefore be used when only very small blood volumes (e.g. blood count) are required. By applying venous stasis (n=26), a minimum blood volume of 3 ml could be obtained in 23.1%, whereas this was only possible in 15.6% of the cases without stasis (n= 32). We therefore recommend venous stasis as well as the use of a Vacutainers system for easier handling. The described location could also be successfully used in bearded seals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002030-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069549-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146067-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180639-6>
Complete Sale of Municipal Housing to International Investors: Governance-Analytical Consideration of the Consequences for Urban Development and Housing Market Processes ¤ The work deals with the internationalization of the housing market in Germany. In this context, the question is pursued of how communication and cooperation on the housing market and in the framework of urban development processes change after the complete sale of municipal housing. Based on case studies in Kiel, Osnabrück, and Wilhelmshaven, municipal and housing economic action strategies and interaction orientations of local actors are related to each other. Even if the knowledge gained with the help of an Urban Governance approach shows large differences in municipal design claims, a principal loss of control after the sale is verifiable. Above all, financially oriented investors and their low investment interest lead to a persistently decreasing design capacity at the neighborhood level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066794-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047297-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222114-6>

Visualizations of the Political: Homophobia and Queer Protest Culture in Poland since 1980 ¤ Homophobic hate in Poland is propagated through posters, pictograms, graffiti and other image types of nationalist, right-wing and Catholic fundamentalist movements. Through the internet and street protests, these homophobic images are disseminated in the digital and urban space. As a result, they have a fundamental impact on Poland's visual culture. Julia Austermann researches these Polish text and image collections before and after 1989, which provide information on homophobia and its visibility and combating. At the center are the analysis of the production of these images, their handling and the associated emotionalization techniques. But also the queer interventions against homophobia are examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131112-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7580659-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000973-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7612596-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140613-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7705503-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4688835-4>
Transnational Law Creation : Elements of a Normative Theory of Lex Financiaria ¤ The markets for over-the-counter (OTC) traded financial derivatives have had significant negative impacts due to the increase in food prices, the influence on the fiscal situation of states, and the buildup of systemic risks. Democratization of these markets is therefore one of the most important tasks of global law. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) shapes the legal infrastructure of these markets as a private institution. Johan Horst examines the legal practice of ISDA and shows that the ISDA regime has developed its own forms of legislative activity, enforcement of law, and adjudication. Due to the massive impacts of ISDA's activities, a normative reconnection is needed through the establishment of transnational responsibility obligations, which can be dogmatically anchored in the horizontal effect of human rights, prohibitions on the indirect effect of transnational contract networks, and a decentralized politicization of transnational law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176888-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027447-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1156950287> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7612596-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137448-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247482-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048786-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419581-3>
Innovative Lighting for Novel Imaging and Lithography Systems ¤ In this work, innovative lighting systems in the fields of microscopy and lithography are investigated. LEDs and LED arrays are used as light sources of the lighting systems in two optical systems, namely Fourier Ptychography and the Lau effect. The coherence properties of the lighting are theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified to affect the two optical applications. The use of spatially coherent lighting using an LED array in Fourier Ptychography enables the resolution to be increased. In practice, a coherent 4f imaging system is built, in which two different lighting concepts are introduced. Both the planar and spherical arrangement of the lighting provide spatially coherent light with each LED. Depending on the position of the LEDs, various lighting angles are realized. The LEDs are sequentially turned on and off, so that some low-resolution intensity images are taken. To reconstruct a high-resolution intensity image using the information of the low-resolution intensity images, two iterative phase recovery algorithms are checked. The reconstruction process corresponds to a broadened transfer function or synthetic numerical aperture. A high-resolution intensity image can be reconstructed using the kFP algorithm or the EPRY-FPM algorithm, but its quality is affected by the faulty optical system. The influence of the wave aberrations of the lighting system and the removal of this influence are discussed. A reduction of these wave aberrations is achieved by introducing a spherical arrangement of the LED array lighting. The use of spatially coherent lighting in the experimental setup for the Lau effect leads to diffraction orders of the grid in the observation plane. Only with spatially incoherent lighting, which is realized with a single LED or an LED array, do periodic triangular Lau strips arise. From the experiment, it is found that the LED array achieves approximately 7 times the optical performance of a single LED. This leads to increased intensities of the Lau strips and reduces the exposure time in the exposure process of the lithography. Depending on the grid parameters, the intensities and periods of the Lau strips vary around the observation plane. By using the Lau strips in optical lithography, three-dimensional structures are realized on both planar and curved surfaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1117717453> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274823-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125154-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519405-1>
Theory of Sustainability: Legal, Ethical, and Political Approaches - An Example of Climate Change, Resource Scarcity, and Global Trade ¤ Sustainability demands durable and globally sustainable forms of life. Politics and law have been little successful in resource and climate protection so far. The transdisciplinary habilitation thesis analyzes and integrates legal, political, social, economic, and ethical discourses and challenges them critically. It develops a foundation including a problematization of the growth thinking and the widespread vague sustainability concepts. Furthermore, the work provides an analysis of the causes of non-sustainability in politics, companies, and individuals as well as possible transformation processes. Furthermore, the author develops a legal and ethical justice, human rights, and institution theory of sustainability.

Shanghai XXL : Everyday Life and Identity Formation in the Field of Extreme Urbanization ¤ Reform, opening up, and rapid globalization are causing an extreme dynamic of development in Chinese metropolises. At the forefront is - as a model example - the dynamic space of Shanghai: Here, economic, urban planning, cultural, and social change converge in a unique intensity worldwide. This study combines, in a theoretical approach specifically developed for these new phenomena, the multifaceted, interconnected dimensions of urban change with the micro-perspective of the young population on their own living world. Thus, a comprehensive access to the space of the future is enabled.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077567-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9>
Contributions to the Automation of Early Design Phases of Distributed Systems ¤ With the rapidly increasing speed of electronic components, systems with increased complexity, networking, and heterogeneity can be developed. This has the consequence that development can only be carried out by teams of specialists. At the same time, development must take place in parallel to enable early product introduction as quickly as possible. In the traditional design process, the design is therefore recorded in the form of a written specification of the overall system and then divided among several teams. This occurs in the early design phases, which are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty about the product. When developing subsystems, assumptions and decisions must be made without being able to assess the impact on the overall system. Coupling effects are largely ignored. Many critical, especially coupling-induced errors, can be discovered at the end of the development process. In addition, optimization of the overall system is not possible, as no overall system model is available. The traditional design process therefore has a high development risk. With the Mission Level Design design approach, instead of a written specification, an executable specification of the overall system is developed after the concept design. This is validated and optimized against the overall system requirements. Subsequently, the specification of the coupled overall system is passed on to several teams for the development of subsystems, which are then integrated again into a single overall system. Integration problems are thus already solved in the early design phases, resulting in a significant reduction in development time and risk. To increase the specification quality and speed in the development of overall system models, standardized methods for describing and evaluating distributed systems, as well as for automated mapping of functions to architecture are developed within the scope of the work. This enables architecture optimization of the overall system already in the early design phases. In addition, methods for transferring the abstract design to implementations are developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261480-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114261-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121677-5>
Bayes filters with improved measurements for visual object tracking ¤ Visual object tracking uses cameras to track target objects in the environment, which has many applications nowadays, such as intelligent surveillance, medical care, intelligent transportation and human-machine interaction. However, it is still a challenging task because of background noises, occlusions, illumination changes and fast motion. The goal of this dissertation is to improve measurements in Bayesian filtering frameworks for visual object tracking as follows: First, we combine multiple visual cues to improve the measurement for lane tracking. The lane is modeled by a linear-parabolic shape, which is a trade-off between accuracy of the fit and robustness with respect to image artifacts. In contrast to previous methods for linear-parabolic lane tracking, we use not only the color and edge information, but also the gradient orientation as visual cues. The lane tracking becomes a statistical reference problem when these local visual cues are available. The probabilistic distribution of lane parameters are estimated from the visual cues by multiple kernel density estimation, which is proved to be very robust to the image noise. Furthermore we use this probabilistic distribution function as the measurement model of the partitioned particle filter to update lane parameters. The experiments show that our novel lane tracking framework has its strength in a new combination and improvement of various advanced methods ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311226-2>

The Effect of System Support on Political Participation: A Comparative Analysis of Western Democracies ¤ How does the support of the political system by society members affect their political participation? So far, the research literature has assumed that individuals with a well-developed support for the political system tend to use written political participation forms, while individuals with a low level of support tend to use unwritten political participation forms. Dominik Allenspach represents the thesis that the effects are u-shaped. This means that both individuals with a well-developed and those with a low level of support for the political system use written and unwritten political participation forms, while individuals who are indifferent to the political system do not participate politically. The author has checked the presence of these effects for various Western democracies. The results show that the effects of the support of the political system on the various political participation forms are primarily u-shaped, but in some cases also inversely u-shaped.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215796-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046584-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120509-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076215-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2>
Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Flow in Pumps with Small Specific Speed Considering the Roughness Influence ¤ In industrial pumps with small specific speed, significant deviations from reality occur in flow simulations. As essential reasons, the faulty modeling of wall boundary layers with the logarithmic wall law and the neglect of the effect of hydraulically rough walls are identified in this work. An improved method is developed and validated using measurements (including wall shear stress). The flow field of a test pump is analyzed and essential phenomena as well as loss sources are worked out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047843-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128988-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053363-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058076-3>

The presented optimization model builds on existing information structures in companies and enables companies to precisely assess the consequences of their decisions. The model includes the integration of environmental levies, emissions trading, the possibility of recycling and the reuse of resources, emissions limits, and limiting environmental damage, which covers almost all relevant aspects for production planning that include corporate environmental impacts. The work provides a comprehensive overview of environmental cost management issues and is therefore of equal interest to both scientists and practitioners.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4361327-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201709-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323274-7>
Risk Management and Risk Control for Young Companies in Growth Industries: Conceptualization of a Theory-Guided Framework for Practice-Induced Corporate Governance ¤ Young technology companies have to overcome 'market entry barriers' in two respects. On the one hand, they must build a certain level of awareness of their company among the target group and in the environment within a short period of time. On the other hand, they must demonstrate the performance capability of their product to their customers. Their competitive advantages and strengths result from innovative products or technological head starts. In the context of success factor research, a multitude of empirical studies have established the causes of the competitive advantages and strengths of young technology companies, while the causes of failures, i.e. the investigation of risk factors, play a subordinate role. Innovative company foundations with above-average growth rates in future-oriented technology industries include not only opportunities but also significant risks with regard to the future development of this company type. The present book deals with this problem, developing a practice-oriented risk control tailored to the specific characteristics of young technology companies. - First, a content-related definition and classification of risk control for young technology companies is carried out. It is highlighted that risk management serves as a function of corporate governance and risk control as its methodical support. - Based on an analysis of the initial situation of young technology companies, the focus is on the implementation of a risk management system. A procedure model for the introduction of a risk management system is developed and an evaluation approach for the instrumental design is worked out. The goal of this evaluation approach is the selection of instruments from the comprehensive business instrumentarium under the aspect of practical use within the risk management process. In addition to the establishment of an integrated risk management process, particularly the functional, instrumental, and institutional design in the individual process phases, the book deals with components of a risk management system, such as the risk management handbook and the risk report system. Finally, essential changes to the concept are addressed due to the consolidation of the risk management process for continuous improvement of risk management. - The book is aimed at lecturers and students of business administration with a focus on controlling, risk management, and corporate governance. It is suitable for executives of young technology companies as well as for auditors and management consultants who care for these companies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070102-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078599-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4>
Modeling and Generation of Combinable User Interface Variants and Their Joint Use in Service Ecosystems ¤ Digitalization enables us to interact with partners (e.g. companies, institutions) in an IT-supported environment and perform tasks that were previously done manually. A goal of digitalization is to combine services from different professional domains into processes and make them accessible to many user groups in a needs-oriented manner. To this end, providers offer technical services that can be integrated into different applications. Digitalization poses new challenges to application development. One aspect is the needs-oriented binding of users to services. To interact with human users and services, user interfaces are needed that are tailored to their needs. For this, variants for specific user groups (professional variants) and varying environments (technical variants) are required. Increasingly, these must be able to be combined with services from other providers in order to cross-domain processes to ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7863462-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4827894-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6>

The Obligation to Close the Airspace over Conflict Zones: An Examination of Sovereign Responsibility in the Wake of the Downed Flight MH17 over Eastern Ukraine ¤ The downing of flight MH17 in 2014 raised the question of whether states are obligated to close their airspace above conflict zones. Relying on the concept of sovereignty as a responsibility, Matina Jozi demonstrates that the obligation to close the airspace can be deduced from public international law and applies her results to the specific case of eastern Ukraine. The table of contents includes Introduction, Part 1: The Occasion of the Investigation, Part 2: Dogmatic Foundations, Part 3: Concretization of General Protective Responsibility, Part 4: Derivation of the Obligation from Other Sources of Law, and Part 5: Violation of the Obligation. The final consideration shows that the downing of flight MH17 has highlighted the dangers of overflying conflict zones and that an efficient protection of civil aviation in certain cases can only be achieved by a duty of the conflict state to close the airspace affected by the conflict.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261304-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137568-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168262-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168243-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4398025-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063693-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162073-2>
Strain field and strain engineering in semiconductor nanostructures: coherent X-ray diffraction imaging and analytical studies ¤ Abstract: In specific magneto-optical, electronic materials, such as Ga1-xMnxAs, the electronic and magnetic properties are set by the concentration of the charge carrier determining component, here by Mn. However, changes in the chemical composition also lead to a change in the order of the system. A good way to approach this problem is the use of external electrostatic fields to obtain a doping effect without changing the composition. This approach not only allows the development of new components but can also be used to investigate quantum phenomena, as the ground state in such systems can be controlled. Epitaxial nanostructures are suitable candidates, as they allow the required quantum confinement. An elastic lattice strain due to a lattice mismatch can be used to influence the observed quantum effects. Ga1-xMnxAs is currently of great interest for spintronic components. Due to its strong magnetic anisotropy, the spin polarization can be reversed by a magnetic field or by electrical triggers. However, the anisotropy also causes an asymmetric charge carrier distribution. Ga1-xMnxAs therefore has a complex, anisotropic representation surface for the magnetic energy and thus a variety of easily magnetizable axes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178309-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316421-3>
Interactions between Organization and Costs of Municipal Building Management ¤ For the management of buildings, various costs arise depending on the type of use. The study shows - based on statewide data from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - a significant correlation between the organization of building management and the resulting costs. Between July 2006 and March 2007, all municipalities in MV with more than 10,000 inhabitants were examined. Municipalities with an organization close to the developed optimal model have only about half the costs per square meter compared to municipalities with a poor organization.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055001-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006191-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4372194-1>
Apartments for workers : social housing, segregation, and stigmatization in urban Brazil ¤ Social inequalities are part of most aspects of daily life and have persistently characterised life in Latin American cities. As such, in Brazil and other countries on the South American subcontinent, unequal housing conditions became a visible expression of social inequality during the twentieth century. Since public and academic debates on unequal housing largely focus on impoverished shanty towns and upper-class gated communities, focusing on the history of social housing challenges and reconfigures conventional scholarship.This study explores the complex relationships between housing policies, socio-spatial segregation and the stigmatisation of residents in the Conjunto IAPI in Belo Horizonte. It utilises a range of sources from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, while interviews conducted with residents in the housing complex complement the analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077811-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066807-1>
Electron Scattering Methods for Structural Analysis of Epitaxial Silicon Carbide Layers ¤ BEGIN The goal of this work is to investigate the application possibilities of various electron scattering methods for the crystal structure analysis of ultrathin layers using silicon carbide as an example. The focus was on the implementation and application of effective simulation procedures. For this purpose, new programs for simulating photoelectron scattering, backscattered electron diffraction, and dynamic effects in electron channeling patterns were developed, which are based on different theoretical approaches. The similarities between photoelectron scattering and electron channeling patterns are used to present a simulation algorithm for photoelectron scattering at crystal surfaces, which has made it possible to perform calculations of complete photoelectron scattering patterns in the context of dynamic Kikuchi band theory. This allows the equivalence of the cluster approach and the Kikuchi band approach to be shown in both directions at complete diffraction patterns. Together with the analyzed backscattering effects of electrons in LEED and RHEED experiments, this contributes to a unified view of electron scattering effects and the models that serve to describe them.

A Contribution to Humidity Compensation of Precision Measuring Instruments ¤ A development direction for reducing the measurement uncertainty of precision measuring instruments is the minimization of the cross-sensitivities of the measuring instruments to disturbing influences. These include all influences acting on a measuring instrument other than the actual measured quantity. A crucial role is played by the three climatic quantities temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The state of the art is that a large part of today's precision measuring instruments are equipped with a comprehensive suppression of disturbing influences. However, the field of reducing humidity dependence still offers considerable potential for further reducing measurement uncertainty. The present work presents a systematic approach to achieving a humidity-independent measuring instrument. Starting from the causes of humidity dependence, methods for reducing humidity dependence are derived. These methods can be divided into two categories: 1. Minimization of the humidity transport responsible for humidity dependence. 2. Compensation of humidity dependence based on mathematical methods. The humidity transport can be almost completely prevented by maintaining a constant relative humidity in the measuring instrument, e.g. by means of humidity buffering. Furthermore, the penetration of moisture into components can be reduced by constructive measures such as encapsulation, sealing, and sealing. Among a variety of variants for modeling the behavior of systems, so-called polynomial models are particularly well-suited for mathematical humidity compensation. With these models, it is possible to describe both the static and dynamic humidity dependence simultaneously. Essential influence on the quality of mathematical compensation is exerted by the model structure as well as the representation variant of humidity (relative humidity, absolute humidity, vapor pressure, dew point temperature, and similar). Experimental investigations are required to determine the humidity dependence of precision measuring instruments. Since there are interactions between temperature and humidity dependence, the time courses of air temperature and humidity must be orthogonal. Only under this condition can statistically secure statements be made about temperature and humidity dependence from the experiments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124257-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286624-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175566-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210374-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125789-3>
American Right and Environmental Protection: A History of Radicalization ¤ In January 1970, Republican Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act, thereby institutionalizing modern environmental policy in the USA. Over the next two decades, federal and state governments implemented extensive measures to protect nature. At the same time, a societal counter-movement emerged: Anti-Environmentalism. Protests against parks, drinking water standards, and renewable energy are now a fixed part of the conservative agenda. Ella Müller traces the historical genesis of this phenomenon. She shows how resistance to individual measures could become a reactionary political project, driven by the fight against liberal America. Based on a broad range of sources and with great narrative power, she reconstructs the history of radicalization: from the 1960s to the Reagan Revolution and the culture wars of the present. This book thus provides significant insights into the development history of the American Right.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032187-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>

Payment Willingness for Value-Added-Services in Freight Transport: Illustrated by Road Freight Transport in Germany ¤ Within the scope of this work, the demand for Value-Added-Services for transport services in road freight transport within Germany is modelled on the basis of a cost minimization calculation by companies and a method is developed to quantify a construct derived from the modelled demand similar to the payment willingness. The author develops a complex traffic demand model based on discrete choice analysis that allows for explicit consideration of qualitative variables such as Value-Added-Services. The model is then tested by means of an internet-based survey of German shippers and forwarders who are potential demanders of Value-Added-Services and first empirical results on the payment willingness for Value-Added-Services are determined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183580-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190481-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258813-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4377258-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308413-8>

Accounting for Economic Ownership in IFRS Reporting: A Comparative Analysis of Illustrative Rules for Selected Legal Institutes ¤ The current IASB Work Plan includes projects such as the re-conceptualization of the recognition of financial assets, leasing accounting, and the framework. Currently, there is a coexistence of different accounting solutions for the subjective assignment of assets, which is problematic both for specific accounting transactions and from a conceptual perspective. A uniform, transaction-based concept is lacking. Sigrun Scharenberg develops a transaction-based and appropriate systematics that enables system-conform and consistent accounting. The focus is on situations where formal legal ownership and economic content diverge, such as Factoring, Asset-backed Securities, Security Assignment, Leasing. The current accounting solutions for this are analyzed and critically evaluated using a uniformly defined risk-chance structure. Existing inconsistencies are also detailed. The final comparative analysis culminates in an aggregated solution concept.

Calcium signal generation and transient receptor potential channel homologues in the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola : [cumulative Dissertation] ¤ Colletotrichum graminicola; calcium signaling; TRP channels; Hyphal tip growth; Aequorin luminometry; Yellow cameleon imaging; calcium channels; filamentous fungi The Object of this thesis was the hemibiotrophic filamentous fungus Colletotrichum graminicola, a pathogen of maize. The first part focuses on the relevance of Ca2+ signals for hyphal growth. Ca2+ signals precede hyphal growth re-initiation, a correlation of Ca2+ spike rate and growth was not found. The second part deals with TRPF-Channel homologues. The gene sequences of the four C. graminicola TRPF-Channel homologues (CgTRPFs) were elucidated by RACE PCR. Trans-membrane topology of all four CgTRPFs was similar to the yeast TRPY1 Ca2+ channel. CgTRPFs were expressed in axenic culture and in plant. CgTRPFs1-3 locate to small vesicular structures while CgTRPF4 resides in the vacuolar membrane. Deletion strains were generated and tested for differences vs. WT in sporulation, growth on different carbon sources, low Ca2+, osmotic stress, Ca2+ signal generation and pathogenicity. In summary no differences were found. This PhD thesis investigated the hemibiotrophic, maize-pathogenic, filamentous fungus Colletotrichum graminicola. Part One focused on the relevance of Ca2+ signals for hyphal growth: Ca2+ signals precede hyphal growth re-initiation, a correlation of Ca2+ spike rate and growth was not found. Part Two analyzed TRPF-channel homologues (CgTRPFs). Four CgTRPFs were found and their sequence elucidated. The transmembrane topology of CgTRPFs is similar to that of the yeast Ca2+ channel TRPY1. The mRNA of CgTRPFs was expressed in axenic culture and in planta. CgTRPF1-3 localize to small vesicular structures, CgTRPF4 was found in the vacuolar membrane. Deletion strains were generated and tested for differences to WT in: sporulation, growth on different carbon sources and with low Ca2+ concentration, osmotic stress, Ca2+ signal generation and pathogenicity.

The pecuniary loss in the embezzlement. The possibility of compensating asset outflows through illegally obtained profits. An examination in the light of recent developments in jurisdiction ¤ In a globalized, competition-oriented market environment, companies are constantly finding 'more creative' ways to increase profits, which the judiciary must evaluate from a criminal law perspective. Often, bribes are paid from the company's cash register to obtain lucrative contracts. -- Due to its abstract formulation, illegal economic activity is usually subsumed under § 266 StGB. The central question here is whether the company suffers a loss within the meaning of § 266 StGB as a result of the illegal diversion or use, or whether this enables lucrative business transactions and thus increases profits. The judiciary is inconsistent in this regard and tends to the former view. This work shows that illegally obtained profits must also be included in the balance and that the judiciary must pay greater attention to the purely economic assessment of asset inflows – also from a constitutional law perspective. / 'The pecuniary loss in the embezzlement. The possibility of compensating asset outflows through illegally obtained profits. An examination in the light of recent developments in jurisdiction': In cases of corporate embezzlement, when an employee uses company funds to obtain lucrative contracts through bribery, a central question is whether the company suffers a loss within the meaning of Section 266 StGB as a result of the bribery or whether its assets are ultimately increased by obtaining the contract. This work shows that illegally obtained profits must be included in the assessment of the economic loss and that the compensation of asset outflows must be assessed purely economically.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187907-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187913-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031980-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187126-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022149-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130534-6>

A temperature-dependent thermodynamic model for the H+ - NH+4 - Na+ - SO2-4 - NO-3 - Cl- - H2O system ¤ Atmospheric aerosol particles play a significant role in various questions of air purification. A substantial part of their mass is formed by inorganic components such as sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate, which are supplemented in the marine planetary boundary layer, inter alia, by sodium and chloride. The effect of an aerosol is dependent on the phase state of the particles, their water content, and the partitioning of volatile components between the gas and particle phase.

CRIC: Context-based Recommendation of Unstructured Texts in Real-time Environments: A Procedure for Determining the Semantic Proximity of Text Objects Based on a Heuristic Asymmetric Distance Measure ¤ The idea of automatically linking content-related texts to each other is not new. The solution approach presented in this work pursues two main goals: working automatically based on unstructured texts and supporting a high number of simultaneous accesses. It differs from other procedures essentially by determining the semantic distance between the texts based on an asymmetric pre-calculated distance matrix. The relationships between unstructured text objects are established using a heuristic algorithm independent of the national language for feature selection. The resulting 'word cloud' is then used as a query parameter for the selection of suitable texts. Content-related texts are recommended to the user for the text currently displayed. The processing speed of the procedure was analyzed in the form of the time complexity of the algorithms. In addition, extensive practice tests were carried out on the website of an industrial magazine over a period of 12 months to test the efficiency of the procedure in terms of the quality of the recommendations. The results show that the presented approach is almost on par with the manually created recommendations of professional editors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4673954-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4617682-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4807493-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728093-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7511891-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7512839-1>

Zeolitic Filters and Membranes in Gas Sensing ¤ Metal oxide gas sensors are widely used today in large quantities to detect flammable and toxic gases in various industrial and everyday life applications. However, the gas-sensitive metal oxide layers used in the sensors are almost exclusively sensitive to multiple gases, resulting in false readings and even false alarms. The reason for this is similar interactions of different gases with the metal oxide surface. In the present dissertation, the use of zeolitic filters and membranes is used to reduce the cross-sensitivity of commercial methane gas sensors to ethanol. These sensors, which are based on sensitive tin dioxide layers, are mainly used in gas warning systems (mining, industry, household). Zeolites (e.g. ZSM-5, Zeolite-A) exhibit excellent catalytic properties and high thermal and chemical stability. They are therefore particularly suitable for use as active filters in front of the gas-sensitive layers of gas sensors. Crystalline zeolite powders are obtained in the work as end products of a series of hydrothermal syntheses. Subsequently, the crystals were partially modified by ion exchange. However, it is technologically more sensible to use zeolite membranes supported on carriers for the use of zeolites as filter material in gas sensors. By a new variant of the in-situ synthesis of zeolite layers on porous carriers made of aluminum oxide and titanium dioxide substrates, the membranes were defect-free produced and also further modified by ion exchange. Zeolite powders and membranes were structurally characterized in numerous investigations. Their catalytic properties were comprehensively tested and documented by means of the conversion of ethanol on acidic zeolites. The suitability of the generated zeolitic membranes for the separation of gas species was confirmed by permeation measurements. The modified zeolites and zeolitic membranes proved themselves in sensor investigations as active filters for the selective detection of methane in various methane-ethanol gas mixtures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259288-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4352375-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067660-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4336638-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237727-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156050-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296416-7>

The Era of Datafication: Media Innovation as a Change of Media Typologies ¤ Introduction -- Media and mediated communication -- Innovation -- Media innovation as change -- The four media typologies -- Quinary media -- Conclusion -- Bibliography. In an era of algorithmic decisions, where precise predictions and personalized recommendations are calculated by data-driven devices, human daily life is no longer only mediated, dematerialized, or digitally transformed, but has been undergoing a datafication process for several years. New technologies such as Big Data analyses, the use of smart objects and services, or artificial intelligence are driving the development of increasingly powerful media. At the same time, these media have grown into hunters and collectors of data. Kira Krüger first extends the established theories of the classification of media typologies established by Harry Pross and expanded by Manfred Faßler, and complements them extensively. Because society has long arrived in the era of datafication, which is shaped by a new media typology, namely the so-called quinary media. The author Kira Krüger has been promoted in media studies at Humboldt University of Berlin with a focus on innovations as a change of media and communication, particularly considering digital transformation and datafication. Professionally, she works as a consultant in innovation consulting for future-oriented projects that want to change the economy and society in the long term.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026926-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4802620-7>
Redistribution Effects of the German Healthcare System: A Microsimulation Study ¤ The German healthcare system is undergoing a transformation. This transformation is primarily evident in the public and scientifically guided discussion on the reorganization of the healthcare system's financing, which is dominated by the concepts of statutory health insurance and the lump sum. The financial changes resulting from these concepts for private households, health insurance funds, and other institutions remain largely unquantified. The methodology developed in this work for the analysis of effects and redistribution enables the evaluation of these changes from an individual, institutional, and macroeconomic perspective. For the evaluation, a computer-based microsimulation model of the German tax and social security system is specified, the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121808-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000120-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023744-8>
A contribution to understanding the recently enhanced coastal siltation in the German Wadden Sea ¤ The impact of human activity on the world's unique coastal system, the Wadden Sea, has permanently changed the coastline and morphology of this system over the last centuries. Stakeholders and harbor operators in the coastal area have been complaining about steadily increasing sedimentation for decades. The task of this dissertation was (1) to find evidence of increasing sedimentation in the period from 1996 to 2016 and (2) to investigate possible cause-and-effect relationships. A topography analysis initially confirmed this by the increase in average mudflat height and sediment volume in the mudflat area. These morphological changes had an impact on the properties of the tide, particularly through decreasing flow velocities, longer slack water duration, and decreasing flood dominance. A reduction in tidal flat volume and higher, broader mudflats likely reduced the energy of waves and tide, which favored sedimentation. The Wadden Sea on the Northwestern European Shelf is world's largest channel-shoal system that comprises broad coherent intertidal flats, islands, shoals, and several estuaries. Coastal management has shaped the Wadden Sea's coastline and its estuaries for centuries which is why navigational channel dredging and coastline maintenance have become routine coastal engineering tasks. Since the 2010s, German coastal stakeholders reported further enhanced coastal siltation. My research objectives were (1) to identify whether there was quantifiable evidence of enhanced coastal siltation and (2) to find the driving processes behind this development. An analysis of bathymetry data confirmed that intertidal flats accreted and that lateral expansion and subtidal deepening occurred. Balanced subtidal and intertidal sediment budgets suggested a redistribution of local subtidal sediments to intertidal flats. In addition, surface sediment data indicated a gradually increasing mudflat coverage over time. Based on this information, numerical modeling and observational data were used to quantify changes in tidal and non-tidal forcing: I found near-constant wind-wave and storm surge conditions which indicated that event-driven phenomena were an unlikely driver. Spatial tidal analysis and observational data revealed amplitude and phase shifts of principle and shallow water tidal constituents which reflected in increased tidal amplitude, and reduced flood dominance. Furthermore, diminishing flood flow velocity and increased slack duration were noted. These phenomena were related to increased relative intertidal storage and to subtidal deepening from bathymetry evolution. Hence, the reduction in channel volume and the intertidal accretion likely decreased tidal and wave energy on the tidal flats and enabled the deposition of more fines. Longer flood and ebb slack duration should add to this effect. The import of sand into the coastal zone was likely reduced as flood dominance diminished at the entire study site.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064847-3>
Improving attitudes towards geometric proof through a suggested story-based dynamic geometry approach ¤ In this work, an approach is presented and explored, in which students are presented with geometric problems through a daily story using dynamic geometry software. This is intended to enable them to recognize the importance of geometry for everyday life, to experience the process of formulating geometric statements and hypotheses together, and to perceive geometric proofs as something that goes beyond the mere confirmation of the correctness of geometric theorems. They begin with the real situation and are guided through seven steps to geometric proofs. The content of the teaching material is structured in a tiered manner, with each unit being a prerequisite for the next, either geometric-structurally or embedded in the story.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7546364-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8>
Organisation-related Participation in Criminal Law: The Statutory Behavior of Organizational Crimes and the Phenomenon of Terrorism Financing ¤ Main description: In the present work, the provisions of §§ 84, 85 StGB, § 20 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 to 4 VereinsG, and §§ 129, 129a StGB are presented as a unified complex of organizational crimes. The focus of this consideration is on the specifically organization-related participation. By this view, the organization is reduced to an environment in which the participatory behavior takes place. With this perspective, Natalia Eroshkina turns against the group-dynamic explanatory approach of organizational crimes. In particular, the work presents the organizational criminal law in connection with the constitutional limits of the freedom of association according to Art. 9 Abs. 2 GG and shows the attribution structure of participation in an association and its manifestation in the system of organization-specific participatory roles. Finally, the protection of legal interests by organizational criminal law is critically questioned. This criticism demands a revision of the protective directions of organizational crimes and the development of the delict structure in the background of the question of how organization-related participatory behavior can impair legal interests in a real cumulative attack. To exemplify the elaborated differences of organizational crimes in relation to further forms of punishable joint action and to single perpetrator offenses, the author links to the phenomenon of terrorism financing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330891-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184327-7>
Determinants of Mode Choice ¤ Transport, transport policy, road construction, public transport, Deutsche Bundesbahn are keywords that are constantly present in our media and attract a lot of public attention. This is not surprising due to the 'everyman' quality of transport. Almost everyone participates in the transport phenomenon and experiences the positive mobility effects, but also the negative ones in the form of congestion or environmental impact. In addition, transport is an input for most production processes. This central social position of transport requires an economic consideration. In Part A, the author deals with the related questions. The focus of the work is on passenger transport, especially on public transport. -- To secure sufficient mobility as a prerequisite for economic and social exchange relationships, public transport and its promotion are an important building block in a comprehensive package of measures. If public transport is to meet the mobility needs of transport users to a greater extent, it must be strengthened in competition with the car. Only then is there a compulsion to minimize costs on the one hand and to create an attractive offer on the other. An expansion of market share through an appropriate product policy is only possible by taking into account corresponding customer preferences. -- The central task for the transport companies is therefore to understand transport users as customers and to align their strategy and organization accordingly. To do this, corresponding information must be obtained. With the help of statistical methods, it is possible to measure the utility creation of specific transport medium characteristics and provide action guidelines for acting in the market. In Part B of the work, relevant methods of applied demand research are presented and their special problem-solving capacity discussed. With the selected special procedure of conjoint analysis, new, innovative public transport concepts can be evaluated in terms of their market opportunities. This also includes finding specific user benefits from the customer's point of view that are only available to public transport or can be made available and can be 'played off' against the car. -- The empirical Part C contains an acceptance study for a new concept between public transport and motorized individual transport (MIV). It can be shown that with corresponding ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173917-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187820-6>

Location-based Advertising in the Context of Big Data: Determinants of Consumer Acceptance ¤ Big Data and customer acceptance in the field of tension -- Determinants of customer acceptance of LBA and their impact on privacy concerns as a central research gap -- Acceptance factors of location-based advertising -- Empirical analysis of the effect of the determinants of acceptance of LBA. Claudius Warwitz shows that privacy concerns play a minor role in the decision to use location-based advertising (LBA) for consumers. On the other hand, brand attachment and trust in the LBA provider and the advertised brand are crucial for consumers to accept and use location-based advertising. As further important determinants, the author identifies brand authenticity, brand image, as well as usefulness, entertainment value, attitude, and personal relevance. In the course of the investigation, 1,237 smartphone users were surveyed regarding their LBA usage behavior for 14 brands.

Titan Catalysts for Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3-Dienes ¤ In this work, it could be shown that a titanium-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of conjugated double bonds in 1,3-diene systems is possible to both branched and linear products. For this reaction at the terminal double bond of the diene systems, several catalysts could be identified as active, for example, aminopyridinato- and formamidinato-based titanium complexes and the already known catalyst Bis(indenyl)dimethyltitan from the hydroaminoalkylation of styrene. The branched products formed in the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3-dienes with N-methylaniline could be converted in a subsequent iodine hydrogen catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination to the 1,2-disubstituted 4-methylpyrrolidines. Two diastereomers could be gained, whose ratio could be controlled by the reaction time. It could also be demonstrated that an intramolecular, hydrogen iodide catalyzed hydroamination procedure can be used to transform the branched hydroaminoalkylation products of 1,3-dienes with N-methylaniline into 1,2-disubstituted 4-methylpyrrolidines. It was possible to gain access to two diastereoisomers which were formed either as kinetic (cis) or thermodynamic (trans) products. The formation of the cis and trans products could therefore be controlled via reaction time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315387-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140648-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3>
4-Iminomethylpyridine : novel Azomethines and metalated 4-Iminomethylene-4H-pyridin-1-ides : reactions with Heterocumulenes and other electrophiles ¤ Novel Ca-imino-functionalized 4-alkylpyridines exhibit increased acidity of the benzyl position (Ca) compared to simple 4-alkyl derivatives such as 4-i-propyl- or 4-benzylpyridine. Deprotonation is achieved with various bases (e.g. n-BuLi, MgEt2, KHMDS, NaH) and results in the strongly mesomerically stabilized 4H-pyridin-1-ide anions. Crystal structure analyses of three metal 4H-pyridin-1-ides demonstrate a preferred coordination of the metal at the pyridine nitrogen N1. Upon reaction of lithium 4H-pyridin-1-ide LiP with various electrophiles such as heterocumulenes X=C=Y, esters, epoxides or aldehydes, addition occurs exclusively at the Ca atom. The primary adducts of CS2, PhNCO and PhNCS with LiP undergo cyclization-oxidation in the presence of a proton source and an oxidizing agent, resulting in the formation of various five-membered heterocycles (thiazoles, imidazolones, imidazolthiones). Reaction of LiP with CO2 yields the open-chain lithium pyridin-4-yliminomethylcarboxylates, which are capable of reversible CO2 fixation due to the very labile CO2 binding and can be characterized as CO2 storage materials. The results of extensive DFT studies at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level include the E/Z isomerism of azomethine 3 and anions, various coordination modes of the lithium ion at the 4H-pyridin-1-ide anion, the adducts of LiP with CO2 and the mechanism of CS2 addition to LiP.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179579-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176471-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151949-8>
Aegis or Achilles heel : the dilemma of homology in biopatents in the wake of Novozymes ¤ Biopatents frequently disclose sequences of polypeptides and nucleic acids in the written description. The claims often cover a homology range surrounding the disclosed sequence to get a broader protection. However, homology claims face a hurdle that they may lack support by the written description. The Supreme Court of China ruled that homology claims lack support, but a further limitation by species of origin satisfies this requirement. This study explains that homology per se should have formed the essence of such disputes. Homology dictates the skilled person’s confidence on the functionality of unknown sequences, and is involved in multiple patentability requirements. Thus, the assessment of support is not an isolated matter. Disparity of different requirements creates an unclaimable gap, and constitutes a discrimination to biotechnology. An appropriate test for the support requirement is thus furnished to confer a scope of protection commensurating to the technical contribution.

LINDA : Performance Management in Networks with Service Quality Adaptation - An Example of an Ethernet Middleware ¤ This work presents a solution proposal for the realization of service quality in Ethernet networks. The central element herefor is a software system consisting of a middleware, which regulates communication in the network according to the specifications. This approach was conceived theoretically as well as practically programmed. The implementation of the solution served as a basis for the performance evaluation of the presented approach. In addition to the evaluation of the characteristic behavior of the middleware under various requirements, studies and alternatives are presented, which show how the system can be adapted in terms of the requirements that arise in larger networks. The presented solution approach offers an alternative to existing service quality functions, which are implemented via communication protocols and Ethernet hardware. The advantage of the middleware lies in the fact that it works independently of the functions of the network, so that no special specifications need to be made for the communication infrastructure. Since the realization of service quality is implemented solely through the software of the middleware, all degrees of freedom are given to adapt the service quality concept freely to individual needs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127501-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426067-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496068-2>
Estimation of forest structure parameters in Mexico by integration of remote sensing and forest inventory data ¤ This work provides insights into the current possibilities and limitations of using remote sensing data for mapping forest structure at local, regional, and national levels in Mexico. In particular, the effects of multisensor and multitemporal remote sensing data on the mapping accuracy of forest structure parameters (i.e., above-ground biomass (AGB) and vegetation height) were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of quality, quantity, and spatial distribution of reference data on the modeling accuracy was investigated. To answer these questions, optical and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing data were integrated with national forest inventory data and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data using various modeling scenarios.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006877-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064394-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195782-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179145-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176765-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064354-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075677-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4229619-5>
Nanotribological Investigations of Ultrathin Water Films on Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Silicon Surfaces ¤ Water has a significant impact on the friction of moving parts in micro- and nanotechnology. The dependence of friction on the water environment and surface chemistry can be investigated using atomic force microscopy at single-point contacts. In model experiments, nanotribological properties - friction, adhesion, and long-term stability - were investigated as a function of water vapor pressure. Measurements were performed on hydrophobic, hydrogen-terminated silicon and hydrophilic and hydrophobic silicon oxide. An oxidized silicon tip was used as a probe. The friction force was characterized as a function of normal force and sliding velocity. The water vapor pressure was reduced by pumping the vacuum chamber from atmospheric pressure to 1E-8 mbar and increased by introducing water vapor into the vacuum chamber from 1E-10 to 1E-5 mbar. The water film thickness was determined separately using dynamic force spectroscopy as a function of distance. This method is based on the analysis of the amplitude and normal force component during the approach of a vertically oscillating cantilever to the probe. The friction of hydrophobic silicon and hydrophobic silicon oxide is independent of water vapor pressure. There is no water present on the surfaces. Both surfaces change to hydrophilic silicon oxide under tribological stress in a water-containing environment, resulting in a change in friction. Hydrophilic silicon oxide showed a strong dependence of friction and adhesion on water vapor pressure. During the reduction of water vapor pressure starting from atmospheric pressure, the water film thickness (from 2.6 to 0.7 nm to no measurable water), friction (from 500 to 200 to 20 nN, given for a normal force of 60 nN), and surface energy (from 556 to 434 to 21 mJ/mø) decreased stepwise over 3 regions. The velocity characteristic also changed over 3 regions. The increase in water vapor pressure is up to 1E-8 mbar associated with the reduction of friction (from 15 to 14 nN) and surface energy (from 68 to 20 mJ/mø). For pressures higher than 1E-8 mbar, friction (from 14 to 16 nJ) and surface energy (from 20 to 154 mJ/mø) increase with water vapor pressure. These properties can be correlated with the different states of water adsorption on silicon oxide. The minimum values for friction and adhesion coincide at the increase and reduction of water vapor pressure. The different time scales for water adsorption and desorption cause hysteresis for adhesion and friction during changes in water vapor pressure.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327470-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064689-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060847-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077445-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274473-8>
Visual Communication Research: Media Images as a Challenge for Communication and Media Science ¤ We live in a visual media culture, a 'visual culture', in which we are constantly confronted with 'images' of various kinds: advertising tries to seduce us with perfectly staged images, press photos make us eyewitnesses to distant wars and catastrophes, and politicians strive to present themselves in a camera-friendly manner. But we also capture all important events photographically in our daily lives, in order to remember them and share them with others. But how can images be deciphered? And how is the communicative 'power of images' to be explained? Katharina Lobinger defines the approach of 'Visual Communication Research' in distinction to other image sciences. In this context, the central research fields are worked out: images in journalism, in advertising, public relations, political communication, and in mediated everyday communication. In a meta-analysis, the author examines the development, establishment, and research activities of 'Visual Communication Research' over the past 20 years and shows which methods were used to produce the findings in previous research. Dr. Katharina Lobinger is a research associate at the Center for Media, Communication, and Information Research (ZeMKI) of the University of Bremen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4783825-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188423-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169194-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114259-7>
Investigations on the Technofunctionality of Egg Yolk Fractions in Fine Baked Goods Using Biscuit and Shortbread as Examples ¤ Egg yolk fractions, cake structure, rheology. - In fine baked goods, such as biscuit and shortbread, the egg is the most important structuring ingredient. It is valued, in addition to taste and nutritional value, primarily due to its three outstanding technofunctional properties: thermal gelation, foam-forming ability, and excellent emulsifying properties, where the egg also plays a decisive role. Egg can now be cost-effectively and on an industrial scale separated into three main fractions: low-density lipoproteins (LDL), granula, and livetine, and freeze-dried using a special process. In this way, the technofunctional properties can be fully retained and utilized. The present work aimed to develop the technofunctional properties of newly developed freeze-dried egg yolk fractions (LDL, granula, livetine) in order to use them specifically in fine baked goods (biscuit/shortbread). Furthermore, the complex relationships in thermally induced gelation of ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259550-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322386-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192147-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274519-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004152-9>
Integration of a Neuro-Sensor into a Measurement System as well as Investigations on Unit Separation ¤ At the University of Rostock, a novel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor chip was used in the framework of a dissertation for the extracellular analysis of electrically active biological cells. This chip, in addition to a MEA (Multi-electrode array), has further FET (Field Effect Transistor)-based sensors for the capture of different cell parameters. In addition to the commissioning of this sensor, external hardware for data acquisition and algorithms for signal processing were designed and implemented. The goal was the creation of a Cell Monitor System (CMS) for the semi-automated use of the silicon-based sensor chip.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140390-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041638-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138132-4>

Automated Modeling of Forest Landscapes for Virtual Worlds and Mobile Robots ¤ Remote sensing data such as aerial images, terrain and surface models are now globally available and have found their place in our daily lives. On the other hand, landscape models for simulations and presentations in Virtual Reality are still often laboriously generated by hand in many cases. Arnold Bücken shows a way to derive forest landscapes on a large scale from remote sensing data in an automated procedure. The result are detailed forest models with geographically located, attributed individual trees that are suitable for a variety of simulation tasks and at the same time offer a highly detailed cartographic recording of the forest, for example for localization tasks of robotic systems.

Medien(sub)culture : Stories - Discourses - Designs ¤ The scientific analysis of the media society is often normatively shaped. Accordingly, predictable and unsatisfying are their findings and interpretations. The study by Christoph Jacke seeks ways out of this dead end by presenting innovative readings of the three prominent theoretical strands Critical Theory (Frankfurt School and successors), Cultural Studies, and sociocultural constructivism. From them, a media culture observation grid with the levels Main and Sub is prepared. The results of this new method show up in the final focusing of the central actors in the media and pop culture, the stars.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175361-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114011-4>
Between Biopower and Life Power: Biopolitical Thinking in Michel Foucault and Ernst Jünger ¤ Are there parallels between Michel Foucault's and Ernst Jünger's political thinking? At first glance, this seems unlikely. However, Nasser Ahmed reveals the same type of biopolitical thinking in Foucault's 'The History of Sexuality, Volume 1' and Jünger's 'The Worker' and shows how close the two approaches are. Between biopower on the one hand and life power on the other, he illuminates a space that has remained invisible in previous political categorizations: Foucault and Jünger stand as biopolitical thinkers on the same side of a fundamental division of political thinking, which understands the political less as a function of communication, but rather as a function of struggle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036824-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115590-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034831-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137810-6>

Properties of polarized electromagnets and their dimensioning based on a design algorithm with an optimization procedure ¤ In the present work, the fundamentals and design possibilities for polarized electromagnets are investigated. First, the basic structures of polarized electromagnets are presented, suitable calculation procedures are described, and the most important properties of permanent magnet materials are presented. Further, the characteristic properties of polarized electromagnets are described and compared with neutral electromagnets. The principal approach to simulating dynamic processes of polarized electromagnets is shown. Finally, various possibilities for the dimensioning of polarized electromagnets are systematically presented. In this, a new general design procedure for the dimensioning of the main dimensions is introduced. With an extended and generally valid design algorithm compared to neutral electromagnets, the design part is completed. The presented examples serve to validate the used calculation and optimization procedures as well as the developed algorithms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151832-9>
Innovation Paths: Evolution and Institutionalization of Complex Technology ¤ The innovation path model presented by Uli Meyer opens up a new perspective on the development of complex technology. It integrates insights from sociological neo-institutionalism and social evolution theories to explain how innovation paths emerge and which mechanisms stabilize and strengthen them. The presented perspective takes into account that technology is increasingly produced in stable networks of many organizations and no longer by individual organizations or inventors. Innovation paths are expressions and drivers of the increasingly routinized and entrenched search for the new. The model is developed using the example of the establishment of electronic systems in the automotive industry, particularly driver assistance systems. Content A sociological perspective on technology development and the underlying processes Innovation paths describe how concrete forms of complex technology development institutionalize and certain technological development dynamics become entrenched Driver assistance systems Electronic development in the automotive industry Target groups Researchers, lecturers, and students of sociology, particularly technology and organization sociology and innovation research Social scientists The author Dr. Uli Meyer works at the DFG Graduate College "Innovation Society Today", Institute of Sociology, Technical University of Berlin. .

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Rouen: Investigations into the Architecture of Normandy in the Early and High Gothic Period ¤ The Cathedral of Rouen, coronation site and burial place of the Norman dukes as well as the metropolitan church of Normandy, belongs to the great Gothic church buildings of the beginning of the 13th century in France. However, the long struggle between the French and English crowns for control over Normandy, which culminated in their military conquest by Philip II Augustus in 1214, leaves its mark on the building history of the cathedral just as much as the inner-city power struggle between the clergy and the emerging bourgeoisie of Rouen. A fluctuating building process with multiple replanning leads to individual solutions, in which the tense confrontation between Norman building tradition and the influences of the High Gothic of Île-de-France is manifested at the same time. - - Based on archaeological and archival investigations, the complex building history of the cathedral is reconstructed. The various building phases with their respective architectural characteristics and style features are shown to be embedded in the artistic environment of Normandy in a dense network of reciprocal relationships with other major construction sites. Questions about the responsible master builders, patrons, and founders as well as the liturgical use are added. The Cathedral of Rouen proves to be a multifaceted mirror of a traditional art landscape in times of historical upheaval	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Convexity properties of moment maps of real forms acting on Kählerian manifolds ¤ Let X be a compact connected Kähler manifold with a holomorphic action of a complex reductive Lie group, such that the action of the maximal compact subgroup U is Hamiltonian, i.e., there exists a moment map for this action. In the present work, we consider projections of this moment map onto subspaces associated to compatible real subgroups G of the above complex Lie group. In particular, we are interested in convexity properties of the image of this new map. A main result is a convexity theorem in the integral projective case for any closed G-stable irreducible semialgebraic subsets of the projective space. As special cases, we obtain classical convexity theorems of Guillemin-Sternberg and Mumford, as well as convexity assertions for complex flag manifolds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162978-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290704-4>
Analysis of Telemetry Signals and Radar Return Signals for Reconstruction of Orbital Perturbations of Interplanetary Spacecraft, exemplified by the simulated descent dynamics of the Huygens Probe ¤ The Cassini/Huygens Mission is a joint venture between NASA and ESA, aiming to explore the Saturn system. The present work was carried out within the framework of the Doppler Wind Experiment. The goal of the work was to develop a method for determining the equilibrium position and amplitude of the pendulum movement of the Huygens probe during the descent on the Saturn moon Titan. The available data are the Doppler frequency shift and the reception power of the telemetry signal. In addition, there is the return signal of the radar altimeter. With the information of the telemetry signal, a deterministic approach and a stochastic approach were developed to determine the parameters of the pendulum movement, depending on whether the measurement data provide sufficient information about the movement, or whether a periodicity of the movement is present. With the return signal of the radar altimeter, an interactive procedure was developed in addition to this purpose.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184655-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173653-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402067-3>
Symmetrization procedures for the isoperimetric problem in symmetric spaces of noncompact type ¤ In the present work, a new symmetrization procedure for the isoperimetric problem in symmetric spaces of noncompact type is developed.

Finally, possible applications of the procedure to the isoperimetric problem are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128462-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156708-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184206-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128763-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162545-6>
Biologically inspired microtechnological tools for microassembly and minimal-invasive surgery ¤ BEGIN \"Natur findet die Form".

The Knowledge Problem in Asylum Law: Between Material Control Deficits and Europeanization ¤ When making an asylum decision, the legal practitioner is faced with the task of determining social and political circumstances abroad. These are questions that cannot be answered by a mere interpretation of legal texts, but require the generation and processing of factual knowledge. Due to the material control concept of German administrative law, this presents a (knowledge) problem for German asylum law dogmatics. The presentation of the shortcomings of established dogmatics, taking into account the Europeanization of migration law, is just as much a topic of this book as the proposal of a re-conceptualization for a partial solution to the asylum law knowledge problem.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003338-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286963-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048765-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062033-5>
Inter-kingdom communication in the marine environment : bacterial modulation of growth, sexual reproduction and biofilm formation of marine microalgae ¤ Microalgae, and particularly diatoms, play a fundamental ecological role and have a wide range of industrial and technological applications. In recent years, research in chemical ecology and biotechnology has focused on molecular mechanisms that regulate the interaction between algae and bacteria. This dissertation investigates the bacterial modulation of sexual reproduction and growth of the pennate model diatom Seminavis robusta. By combining metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches, as well as physiological bioassays and targeted analyses, we discovered novel interactions between algae and bacteria. The bacteria associated with the S. robusta mating type – (MT-) have different influences on the sexual reproduction of diatoms. Bacteria have a special influence on the amino acid metabolism of S. robusta and trigger an oxidative stress reaction in diatoms. Furthermore, they influence the growth and metabolism of another microalga, Nannochloropsis sp., but do not induce biofilm production in bioreactors. These findings are important to understand the outstanding importance of algae-bacteria communication from the perspective of algal cultivation and production. This could promote the use of microbial communities with increased productivity in bioreactors. To better discover signal molecules transmitted through water, we finally developed a new, non-destructive method for the extraction of primary and secondary metabolites from algal surfaces. The results of this dissertation show new insights in the relatively young field of microalgae-bacteria interactions, by applying and linking various approaches (omics techniques, physiological bioassays, innovative analytical procedures) in a broad interdisciplinary approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030509-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138579-2>

Investigation of the Membrane Potential of Smooth Muscle Cells of the Abomasal Musculature and its Influence by Ketone Bodies, Calcium and Potassium ¤ Abomasal displacement, membrane potential, smooth musculature. - Abomasal displacement (AD) of cattle is a widespread disease of the gastrointestinal tract in high-performance dairy herds, whose pathogenesis is not fully clarified. Ketosis, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia are often associated with reduced abomasal motility, without being able to name possible causal relationships. The goal of this work was to provide a contribution to the clarification of the pathogenesis of AD. To this end, the fluctuations in the membrane potential, so-called slow waves, were first characterized by microelectrode technique as the basis of contraction of smooth muscle cells in the abomasum of various ruminants, in order to investigate in the further course of the work a possible influence of slow waves by different calcium concentrations, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as ketone bodies and barium as potassium channel blocker. In the final part, the results of the intracellular recordings were also checked on the level of contraction activity by in vitro motility measurements. For the microelectrode measurements as well as for the in vitro motility measurements, muscle samples of the circular muscle layer of the abomasal wall were prepared and incubated in buffer solutions. For the microelectrode measurements, a total of 23 bulls were tested. The time course of membrane potential fluctuations was measured in solutions with 1.2 mmol/l CaCl2 as well as with 2.4 mmol/l CaCl2. In addition, the effect of 5 mmol/l BHB (under hypo- and normocalcemic conditions) and 2 mmol/l barium chloride (under hypocalcemic conditions) was tested. The samples of the total 13 slaughter animals were only measured in buffer solutions with 1.2 mmol/l CaCl2 in the time course, under the influence of 5 mmol/l BHB and with 2 mmol/l barium chloride. Also from goats, samples of the abomasal wall were available. These were divided into two groups: 4 goats had been fed under normocalcemic conditions and were considered as a control group, which was only measured with buffer solution and 2.4 mmol/l CaCl2, while the second group, 5 goats, were exposed to a restrictive calcium supply...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128755-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157472-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069806-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451398-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296663-2>
Multicomponent 3D-printing for core-shell capsule composites and supramolecular polymers ¤ 3D print, Fused deposition modeling, Polymers, Supramolecular, Capsule, Click, Copper, Mechanophore, Polyisobutylene, Encapsulation The critical manufacturing process is the simultaneous build up of capsule shell and liquid core filling in a layer by layer approach for micrometer sized capsules. As a proof of concept “click”-reaction systems, based on liquid trivalent resin monomers, are manufactured. PCL composites with nano- and micro-fillers are combined with reactive liquids. The 3D-printed core-shell capsule composite can be used for post-printing reactions. With a similar approach, stress‐sensing materials, based on high- and low molecular weight mechanophores are manufactured. Another concept for 3D-printing multi-material composites is based on hydrogen-bonded supramolecular polymers. The printability is relies on reversible thermal- and shear-induced dissociation of the supramolecular interactions, which generates stable and self-supported structures after 3D-printing. The supramolecular PIB polymers showed a rubber like behavior and were able to form self-supported 3D-printed objects at room temperature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1032223197> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170473-3>
Reverse-conductive IGBT with nearly gate-emitter voltage independent diode characteristic ¤ In this dissertation, a novel Trench RC-IGBT concept, called RC-GID-IGBT, is proposed. This new RC-IGBT structure allows operation with a conventional IGBT gate drive and has reverse recovery charge in diode operating mode as low as a state-of-the-art freewheeling diodes. This is achieved by introducing dedicated areas for the diode operation as well as an auxiliary schottky emitter into the IGBT chip without generating negative electrical effects on the IGBT mode. As a result, the novel RC-GID-IGBT can take full advantage of the thermal benefit.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058102-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167286-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197163-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240294-3>
Targeted Micro- and Nano-Integration of DNA and DNA-Superstructures in Micro-Structured Chip Layouts ¤ In this work, techniques for the targeted integration of DNA molecules were presented and optimized. This enables the use of DNA as a scaffold molecule for nanoscale, electrical components. Subsequent metallic functionalization is necessary. DNA-based nano-construction (bottom-up) was performed using self-assembly. This allows for precise, guided integration of DNA into existing top-down microstructures, as well as subsequent functionalization (biomolecular). The use of assembled DNA superstructures (G-wires) as a biomolecular building block could also be shown in addition to long DNA molecules. Through precise correlative characterization of the integrated structures during and after the integration steps, optimization and establishment could be achieved up to the integration of DNA single molecules using dielectrophoresis. The integration of lambda-DNA was transferred from the layer silicate glimmer onto glass and silicon substrates. On unstructured substrates, stretching was performed using the method of drying droplets. Different surface properties have an impact on the stretching behavior of DNA molecules. Further decisive factors are the droplet size and the DNA concentration. The optimum lies at a DNA concentration of 6 ng/mL and a droplet volume of 0.5 ?L. On microstructured substrates, the efficiency of electrode bridging with DNA strands depends decisively on the DNA concentration and the preferred direction during drying. Single-molecule bridges can be realized at low DNA concentrations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4255721-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4732034-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070512-2>
Investigation of Planting Variants and Filter Zone Perfusion of Small Ponds ¤ Abstract: The present work investigates the interactions of various planting and perfusion variants of swimming pool filters with the water quality of the free water and the filling water demand as well as the aesthetics and vitality of the planting, in order to find solution approaches for the following problems in the operation of private swimming pools: - unwanted growth of filamentous algae due to a too high total phosphorus content. - lack of vitality and damage patterns in the usual planting of swimming pool filters, caused by nitrogen deficiency. - The processed research goals are: 1. Reduction of algal growth in the swimming pool by plant mixtures with low transpiration, which reduces the required filling water volume and the associated phosphorus input. 2. Reduction of filamentous algae development by influencing the water hardness through sphagnum planting 3. Development of a vital, functional and aesthetically appealing planting. - The data used in the work were collected in a test facility consisting of 24 swimming pool models with free water and planted filter area. The planting variants "no planting", "calciferous moor", "high moor" and "conventional" were tested in combination with the perfusion variants "no perfusion", "from top to bottom" and "from bottom to top" using visual assessments, investigations of relevant water parameters and determination of filling water volume and algal dry mass. - From the results of the work, the following recommendations are derived: - By planting with peinomorphic growth form moor plants, the filling water demand and the associated phosphorus input can be reduced. - By planting the filter surface with suitable sphagnum species, the hardness of the pool water can be reduced and a lower filamentous algae occurrence can be achieved. - Plant mixtures from oligotrophic plant species of calciferous moors form a vital, sustainable and optically appealing target vegetation for nutrient-poor swimming pools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7596135-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017164-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144593-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426800-2>
Integration of Electric Drives in Mobile Agricultural Machinery ¤ Introduction -- Integration of drives in mobile agricultural machinery -- Drive systems in mobile agricultural machinery -- Decision-making aids for evaluating drive chains -- Research and developments on electric drives in agricultural machinery -- Development study of the integration of functions for the drum drive -- Test stand investigations for determining the characteristic curves.-Labor experiments for functional testing in the material flow -- Summary -- Outlook. In the present book, the integration of functions is explained and implemented using the example of an electric drive in mobile agricultural machinery. So far, the integration of functions has not been carried out in mobile agricultural machinery. The drive types mechanics, hydraulics, and electricity were compared and evaluated with each other according to various evaluation criteria. The state of the art of electric drives in agricultural machinery was comprehensively and completely researched and described from the first use in the 19th century to the present day. With introduced and calculated complexity costs, the complexity of an electric drive chain can be estimated in the concept phase compared to the usual mechanical drive chain. The functionally integrated electric drive was compared with the state of the art and with data taken in the field in the test stand and laboratory. The advantages of the integration of electric drives are described as better power density and power-to-weight ratio. The higher construction effort and the currently high material costs for electric drives are disadvantageous. The author Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Aumer studied electrical engineering and information technology with a focus on methods of automation technology. He was a scientific employee at the Chair of Agricultural Systems Technology at the Technical University of Dresden.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142903-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014238-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123857-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123177-6>

Materia prima : On the Semantics of the Concept in Natural Science Manuscripts of the 16th Century ¤ Materia prima as physical principle of existence -- Materia prima as pre-physical principle of existence -- Mataria prima as metaphysical principle of existence Katharina Dück devotes this book to the extensive doctrine of the concept „Materia prima“ in the field of tension between theory and repeatable practice in German-language alchemical-natural science manuscripts of the 16th century. She contributes new aspects to the debate on materialism in the Early Modern Period. Texts of so-called master thinkers as well as testimonies of those who have been little considered so far are examined. Special attention is paid to the Corpus Paracelsicum and the Paracelsian current. Three raster-like outlined basic patterns, to which the „Materia prima“-conceptions are assigned, are presented in detail and the continuities and transformations of existing matter concepts are found.

The influence of ceramic particles on texture formation during hot rolling of magnesium wrought alloys ¤ The influence of ceramic particles on texture formation during hot rolling of magnesium wrought alloys has been investigated. The starting material for deformation has been produced by casting. For this purpose basic experiments concerning the fabrication of particle modified alloys in gravity die casting were necessary. Agglomeration of particles proved to be a central problem. AZ31 based alloys have been selected for an application oriented rolling procedure. The desired weakening of the texture of the sheet material could not be accomplished. This is because the deformation degree obtained in the passes of a conventional nonisothermal rolling process is too low to activate mechanisms like particle stimulated nucleation. Furthermore the content and morphology of the ceramic particles could be identified as critical parameters for texture weakening. The findings of this work expand the state of knowledge concerning the influence of particles on recrystallization of magnesium wrought alloys and allows for a more purposeful development of alloys with improved texture formation.

Cost-effective and comparable monitoring components : an interdisciplinary approach based on remote sensing, landscape structure assessment and social research for Bach Ma National Park, Vietnam ¤ Monitoring, Vietnam, Landscape structure, Empirical social research, National park, Protected area, Landsat, Landscape monitoring, Landscape structure analysis, Bach Ma National Park, interdisciplinary, RapidEye, Landscape Monitoring, Landscape Metrics, Social research, Remote sensing, Protected area management All human activities have transformed one-third to one-half of the Earth's land surface. There is a strong correlation of human well-being with ecosystem function, including poverty alleviation programs as well as enhancements of the health sector. To assess and evaluate the progress and outcome of initiatives stringent periodic observation is necessary. The presented approach combines the strengths of remote sensing and GIS analysis with social research applications. The Bach Ma National Park as an area under investigation was designated as protected area in 1991 and extended in 2008. The national park is uninhabited, but in the surrounding buffer zones approximately 62,000 to 79,000 people live in rural areas and in mostly impoverished conditions. The comprehensive nature conservation efforts of the Vietnamese Government during the last two decades has led to growing forest coverage of both plantation and natural forests. Nevertheless, the decreasing biodiversity and ongoing illegal logging and hunting activities in the national park are seen as major threats to conservation initiatives in the future. The remote sensing component consists of an analysis of a time series of Landsat images with seven steps ranging from 1973 to 2010. The resulting land cover analysis had 13 different classes. The accuracy assessment revealed an overall accuracy ranging from 84 to 90%. The basis for the second monitoring component was the Landsat images.

Computer Graphics : On the History and Production Aesthetics of Synthetic Images ¤ There are numerous procedures for generating digital images. However, this diversity makes it difficult to distinguish digital photographs, AI, or CGI images from one another. Carolin Scheler presents a fundamentally new approach to aesthetically analyzing digital image products using the example of 3D computer graphics. Starting from the production process, she describes computer graphics as an independent expression procedure and works out an inherent ideological conception of realism in computer-generated images. It becomes clear: In computer graphics software development, a specific world feeling is always inscribed - with effects on the relationship between image and reality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113418-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123984-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010450-3>
Quality of the Auditor's Examination: Influence of the Mandate Duration on the Accounting Policy of the Client ¤ The question of how a statutory limitation of the mandate duration of the auditor contributes to an increase in the quality of the examination has been the subject of a controversial discussion for more than 30 years. The debate on such external rotation of auditors was triggered by numerous accounting scandals in recent years, which have led to doubts about the quality of the audit. Daniela Wiemann analyzes for the first time in an empirical study the influence of the mandate duration of the auditor on the examination quality for Germany. To measure the examination quality, she examines the accounting policy in the audited consolidated financial statements of the companies listed in the CDAX.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047968-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126457-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313854-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066500-8>
The Constitutionalization of International Law from a Systems-Theoretical Perspective ¤ The book deals with the question of the constitutionalization of international law and illuminates this from a systems-theoretical perspective. The work first intensively deals with the systems theory of Niklas Luhmann and then analyzes both prevailing constitutionalization and fragmentation tendencies. In detail, the approach of the so-called Societal Constitutionalism is addressed and the main thesis of the representatives of this approach is critically evaluated. Finally, the work illuminates the constitutionalization of international law under systems-theoretical aspects and investigates to what extent an autonomous or even autopoietic law and politics system exists on an international level and whether these two systems are connected by a kind of structural coupling analogous to the national state level. In essence, the work affirms the existence of a structural coupling and thus also a constitutionalization at least in a weakened form Introduction -- 1.

Ecological Consumer Information: Foundations, Methods, and Effectiveness Opportunities ¤ Increasing environmental problems are the burden that the past has transferred to the new millennium. It remains questionable what ecological role the demander should have and with what means an environmentally friendly consumer behavior can be promoted. Economic foundations on the costs and benefits of ecological action on the one hand, socio-psychological interdependencies and psychology of consumer behavior on the other hand form the scientific poles of the present investigation. Effective behavior corrections are linked to the convictions of the individual consumer regarding the results of his actions, the expectations of others as well as the individually to be mastered barriers. The empirical results show where the promising focal points of ecological consumer information lie. It is about an information that is oriented towards the needs of consumers, which answers application-related questions in detail in quick access, accentuates positive achievements instead of failures and refrains from general moralizing. This information is not only demanded by the state and consumer and environmental associations, but also by the companies in a pressing manner	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066409-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201709-9>
Behavioral Changes and Organizational-Technical Optimizations - A Strong Team for Energy Savings: Experiences and Insights from Psychological Studies on Energy Consumption Behavior at Universities ¤ Summary: In times of looming climate change, rising energy prices, and tight budgets, exploring all possibilities for the most efficient use of energy is a fundamental social and economic obligation. Universities play a special role in this regard due to various factors. As numerous initiatives show, the political and social goal of sustainable development has also found its way into universities. In particular, measures to reduce energy consumption can help universities maintain or even expand their financial leeway, which is becoming increasingly narrow due to rising consumption and prices for energy, despite a fixed budget and a high proportion of fixed costs. While technically oriented measures such as renovations or an energy-optimized building operation are associated with significant potential, they may encounter obstacles in financial, structural, organizational, or technical areas. In addition to these potential, others are often available that can be accessed with minimal investment measures and changes in user behavior. The exploration of user needs, goals, and actions in relation to their respective spatial, social, and cultural environment and corresponding possibilities for voluntary energy-saving measures are genuine psychological tasks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075584-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139846-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014692-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7>
Biomechanical Analysis of the Level Locomotion of Ancylometes Bogotensis (Keyserling, 1877) (Chelicerata, Arachnida, Lycosoidea) ¤ Spider legs are characterized by their bow-shaped configuration and are unique in the animal kingdom due to their hydraulic stretching mechanism. So far, it has been assumed for spiders that there is a stereotypical, speed-independent gait pattern and that the hydraulic mechanism plays an essential role in power generation. The global kinematics and individual leg-ground reaction forces of the continuous and accelerated, level locomotion of the South American running spider Ancylometes bogotensis were investigated. In this process, three gait patterns could be distinguished on the basis of discontinuous speed dependencies of various kinematic parameters. The directions of the ground reaction force vectors show that the hydraulic mechanism does not significantly contribute to the generation of ground reaction forces in either continuous or accelerated locomotion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132662-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122917-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017975-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005330-1>
Planning method for integration and expansion of renewable energy sources with special attention to security supply in distribution system ¤ The current structure of the power grid and the power markets promote the introduction of new energy producers and products. Due to the variability of prices for fossil fuels on the world market, which already takes into account their impending increasing scarcity, the implementation of policies to control the reduction of CO2 emissions and a more efficient use of energy must be incorporated into new grid expansion projects. They force new forms of expansion of the power grid without impairing their economic growth to be sought. This expresses a challenge, to maintain this growth and the changes in the vision of the security of the electricity supply, which is based on the current transmission and distribution networks, the uncertainties of competition on the power market and the effects of decentralized energy generation. The increase in resources of decentralized generation is increasingly observed worldwide and depends on the costs of technologies, market design, and subsidies. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternatives that develop a sustainable strategic plan for the expansion of the power grid. Currently, efforts are being made in the development of planning models with income from decentralized energy generation, renewable energy, market connection, and the power of electrical system planning, which are being undertaken. In this dissertation, a general planning model for the expansion of the power grid is proposed. This model should enable the expansion of the electrical installation and coordinate the proposed solutions. The proposed model combines a temporal and spatial load prognosis module, which optimizes the distribution of the load into the network, the proposal of new power plant projects and their branches, the planning of transmission and distribution networks, and the classification of proposed projects. The optimization model combines classical methods with the exploratory development of other mathematical tools. The model is applied to a real system and shows its potential use for an analysis of the introduction of new consumers. The direct effects on each variable included in the analysis are mainly due to the introduction of new components such as energy efficiency tariffs and the classification of projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166833-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049560-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279392-0>
Self-assembly, rheological properties and self-healing studies of supramolecular polymers in the bulk state ¤ Thymine/Triazine hydrogen bonding; supramolecular dynamic polymer network; supramolecular block copolymer; telechelic polymer; Self-assembly; self-healing property; disordered micelles; SAXS; rheology; unspecific hydrogen bonding In this thesis, we studied three different supramolecular polymer systems with small angle X-ray scattering and rheology to investigate the structure formation and the mechanical properties of supramolecular hydrogen bonding groups functionalized polymers in the bulk state. Several nanostructures were found in the supramolecular polymer systems. For the hydrogen bonding functional nonpolar polyisobutylene samples, micellar nano-aggregates were formed, driven by the demixing between the hydrogen bonding groups and the main chain. Unspecific hydrogen bonding was also found, which can act as another driving force. For the supramolecular block copolymer, the main driving force is the demixing between two polymer blocks and the specific hydrogen bonding was found to be very effective. Self-healing properties were studied with dynamic rheological measurements and it was found to contain a process which is related to terminal relaxation and a slow perfectioning process	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126830-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064787-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146026-1>
Dynamic partial self-reconfiguration : quick modeling, simulation, and synthesis ¤ In this work, OSSS+R is presented as an approach to simplify the design of dynamically partially reconfigurable systems with FPGAs. Modeling is done object-oriented and uses both polymorphic elements and the concept of virtual hardware. The focus is on simple modeling and changeability rather than maximizing degrees of freedom in expression. The models can be simulated using a C/C++ library and SystemC. A synthesis on RTL level is described and in part demonstrated by implementation in a tool called „Fossy“. The generated models match cycle-accurately in their time behavior with the OSSS+R description. To evaluate the approach, the presented design flow was applied to a model in C/C++ up to execution on an FPGA prototyping platform. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4347749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306238-6>
Journalistic Source Protection in German and European Law ¤ Who is today as a journalist entitled to claim source protection? In view of the technological development in the field of media and an increasing number of attacks on media freedom, this question has gained new relevance in recent times. From this perspective, the author compares the legal situation of source protection, i.e. the protected trust relationship between an informant and a journalist, in German law, in the system of the European Convention on Human Rights, in the law of the European Union, and in US-American law, and always focuses on the journalist. Thus, the work should be of particular interest to legal scholars and journalists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7631267-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028781-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7732453-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047160-3>
Characterization of MOS Transistors before and after Gate Oxide Breakdown ¤ The continuous scaling of integrated circuits in the last decades has led to gate oxide thicknesses below 2nm in MOS transistors of state of the art technologies. Breakdown of such thin oxides becomes intrinsically more likely, and the 1 billion transistor chip is already within reach. Therefore, the probability of having at least one oxide breakdown within the projected circuit lifetime of 10 years seems quite high. In this work, the characteristics of MOS transistors before and after gate oxide breakdown are studied. Different categories of breakdown are identified and models for the dc characteristics as well as the noise (random telegraph signals) after breakdown are developed. The models are implemented to analyze the effect of breakdown on different analog and digital circuits. It is shown that, according to the application and breakdown type, circuits may be functional after breakdown of a transistor. With the presented approach it is possible to point out critical transistors in the circuit and analyze the impact of breakdown during the design stage.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Physical Hydrogels on Polyurethane Basis ¤ Physical hydrogels are currently gaining interest as cell substrates, as viscoelasticity or stress relaxation is a significant parameter in mechanotransduction that has been previously neglected. In this work, multifunctional polyurethanes were designed that form physical hydrogels through a novel gelation mechanism. In water, the anionic polyurethanes spontaneously form aggregates, which are held in solution by electrostatic repulsion. A rapid gelation can be achieved from here through charge shielding, whereby aggregation proceeds and a network is formed. This can be achieved by adding various acids or salts, so that both acidic (pH 4-5) and pH-neutral hydrogels can be obtained. While conventional hydrogels on a polyurethane basis are typically produced using toxic isocyanate-containing prepolymers, the described physical gelation mechanism is suitable for in situ applications in sensitive environments. Both hardness and stress relaxation of the hydrogels can be set independently over a broad range. Furthermore, the hydrogels are characterized by excellent stress regeneration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175327-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156459-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160909-8>

The Migration Behavior of Employees in the Media Industry: An Empirical Investigation of the Residential and Workplace Choice, Satisfaction, and Relocation Decision of Talents in German Metropolises ¤ From the introduction: Cities are in an „interurban war for talent“. Therefore, it is important for cities that pursue a person-oriented approach to know how to win this fight. They must have knowledge about which location factors and to what extent the location factors attract talented people and keep them at their current residential and workplace. I will answer this question in my dissertation project, where the focus of the work is on talents from the media industry. The main goal of the work is the analysis of the migration behavior of employees in the media industry. This includes the identification of the factors that determine the residential and workplace choice, overall satisfaction, and relocation decision. Since employees of the culture and creative industry in Germany in general and those of the media industry in particular concentrate in the large cities, employees from the four metropolises with more than one million inhabitants are considered in this study. That is, those who live and work in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne. The theoretical contribution of this work lies in the testing of existing theories on the residential and workplace choice of talents. In particular, the explanatory contribution of the theory of the Creative Class to the migration behavior of media professionals in German metropolises is tested. Furthermore, relevant location factors from migration research are to be analyzed and the differences in the relevance of individual factors between the four media metropolises are to be uncovered. The practical contribution of the work lies in generating new knowledge on the migration behavior of talents from the media industry. On the basis of the identified influencing factors, it will be possible to derive recommendations for policy and urban marketing. This will enable the German metropolises to position themselves as attractive residential and workplace locations for employees in the media industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131660-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125924-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005227-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076600-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Biography and Educational Culture: Portrayals of Individuals by Pliny the Younger, Gellius, and Sueton ¤ What significance did biographical information hold in the educational culture of the 2nd century AD, and which literary forms were chosen for the presentation of individuals? Under this double guiding question, Dennis Pausch investigates portrayals of individuals in the letters of the younger Pliny, the miscellaneous work of Aulus Gellius, and the imperial biographies of Sueton from a genre-transcending perspective. Sales arguments: - of interest to both literary scholars and ancient historians - new insights through genre-transcending interpretive approach - important results on cultural communication in the Roman imperial era	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112763-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006804-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042976-3>
Function of the Transcription Factor CbfA in Dictyostelium discoideum ¤ The CbfA mutant JH.D showed a failure of multicellular development. Expression of CbfA in a low-copy situation caused a healing of the phenotype, which is why this system could be used to gain clues about the functions of individual CbfA domains by expressing mutated CbfA proteins. It turned out that the catalytic activity of the JmjC domain was not essential for the mediation of multicellular development by CbfA. The exchange of a conserved histidine in CbfA for alanine in the first zinc finger motif or the deletion of both zinc fingers resulted in a loss of function of the CbfA protein. Complementation of the CbfA suppression strain with CbfA, which had mutations in the AT-hook region, led to the restoration of aggregation. However, this resulted in premature termination of multicellular development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122166-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4317840-6>
Studies of intestinal barrier functions of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, under feeding modulation and pathogen challenge ¤ Intestinal barrier, Common carp, Pathogen. - The epithelium that lines the mucosal surface in the intestine of animals performs important barrier functions, including the selective uptake of nutrients and the transport of ions and water, as well as the protection of the mucosa and the tissues beneath the mucosa from luminal antigens, toxins, or pathogenic invaders. To improve fish production and fish health in aquaculture, a more comprehensive knowledge of these different functions in the intestine of fish is necessary. In aquaculture, particularly the provision of fish with highly digestible, nutritious, and affordable feed, the protection of fish from infectious diseases, or the treatment of infectious diseases are challenges that have significantly burdened fish production, including that of the common carp, for a long time.

Climate Change in the Context of the Climate System: Cognitive Development Processes Regarding the Climate Concept in the Context of the Linking of School and Out-of-School Learning ¤ This dissertation explored, within a design-based research framework, the medium-term impact of linking school and out-of-school learning (OLE) on a systemic understanding of climate change among 7th grade students. A method mix was used for this purpose. While a written test suggested a significant improvement in systemic understanding, a qualitative content analysis revealed both a heterogeneous and discontinuous development. The results indicate that ideas about dynamic processes in the climate system were mostly developed by the analogue and digital models used in class. With regard to OLE, motivational factors and memorable personal experiences emerged as essential for the cognitive development process. However, for students with lower performance development, no general positive effects of extracurricular learning could be proven.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031170-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418290-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062005-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234453-0>
Architecture of a Knowledge-Based Threat and Risk Analysis of IT Systems with Automated Selection and Integration of Security Mechanisms ¤ The security of application systems of companies is increasingly becoming a decisive factor for the continued existence of companies. This results from the availability requirements for systems and data that are needed for the business processes of companies, and from external requirements such as the data protection act. In order to be able to evaluate an application system with regard to security, risks are identified with the help of threat and risk analysis. The so-identified risks must be reacted to by suitable modification of the application system. In the consistent implementation of the analysis and later security measures, the analyst is only insufficiently and in part supported by the existing procedures. The present work deals with a comprehensive procedure model for the threat and risk analysis of application systems and their security through the integration of security mechanisms. In this procedure model, possible security mechanisms are determined based on the results of the analysis conducted, taking into account the risk emergence, and their effects on risk emergence and the costs incurred are presented. Based on this information, the system operator is supported in selecting a security alternative. Thus, the results of this work enable a regular threat and risk analysis and contribute to the development of secure and the security of existing application systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069386-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4684292-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274324-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113491-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480091-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011144-1>

Spaces of Change : Innovations and their Transfer in the Field of Education and Upbringing ¤ How and in what way is the transfer of innovation in the field of education and upbringing influenced? Inka Bormann addresses the question of how something hybrid like innovation can be theoretically and conceptually precisely captured and empirically determined. In doing so, she takes a knowledge-analytical perspective and designs a model of discursive innovation, which she unfolds and discusses against the background of educational governance research. The author thus makes a contribution to the systematization and theoretical foundation of educational innovation research as well as to the investigation of governance in the field of education and upbringing.

Development of novel catalysts for the photocatalytic hydrogen formation ¤ For the future conversion of sunlight into chemical energy, step-by-step intramolecular working systems for artificial photosynthesis were built. In this process, a number of new ligands and resulting charge-transfer chromophores (Ru(bpy)3-like) and catalytically active complexes (Pt, Pd) were produced. These were combined into heteronuclear diads, which consist of covalently linked functional subunits. In particular, the chromophore and catalytic center were bridged in such a way that their individual properties remained, but their individual functions functioned as a supramolecular photocatalyst in combination. Thus, it becomes possible under light irradiation to reduce protons to hydrogen at these catalysts. For this purpose, oligodentate ligands were produced and used as bridging units, which can coordinate the active metal centers via bipyridines and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC). A number of such heterobimetallic complexes, whose starting compounds as well as suitable reference compounds were produced, characterized and compared with each other. In addition to structural, photophysical, and electrochemical analyses, successful catalysis experiments with the generated photocatalysts for light-driven hydrogen production from water were also carried out. Similarly, representative control experiments and additional analyses using dynamic light scattering were performed to gain a deeper understanding of the processes during the catalysis. By comparing the properties of the produced catalysts with selected reference compounds, further statements about the structure-property relationships of the systems could also be derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266702-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4820049-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038898-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193873-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055572-0>

EPR Spectroscopic Investigation of the Solvation of Amphiphilic Substances in Aqueous Medium ¤ In the present work, the phase separation behavior of responsive poly(phosphoester)s (PPEs) with identical side group structure but different copolymer composition, as well as the solvation process of nitroxide spin probes in aqueous medium was investigated in detail using EPR spectroscopy. From a methodological point of view, this work impressively demonstrates the enormous potential of EPR spectroscopy, which shows remarkably high sensitivity and precision even with comparatively simple CW measurement technique. Moreover, this work also illustrates how much the solvation of amphiphilic substances in an aqueous medium can differ and thus shows in an impressive way the unbelievable adaptability of water with respect to its solvation behavior and emphasizes its unique character.

Quality Intelligence : IT-based Decision Support for Preventive Quality Assurance in the Early Phases of the Vehicle Development Process ¤ Introduction -- Business and technical fundamentals -- Case Study on the exploration of preventive concept assurance – methodology and findings -- Development of a professional concept for decision support of preventive concept assurance -- Prototypical realization and evaluation -- Abstraction, appreciation and research needs. Due to the high dynamics and complexity in the context of vehicle creation, product quality is a major challenge for the long-term competitiveness of automobile manufacturers. Product quality is particularly influenced by decisions made in the early phases of automotive development. Studies show that the availability of relevant quality-related information can make a significant contribution to decision-making in this context. The goal of the research work is therefore to develop an IT-based approach to decision support in favor of preventive assurance of product concepts in the early phases of the automotive product development process. The solution path of the present work includes an exploration of preventive assurance of product concepts in the early vehicle development phases. Based on the findings of the investigation, a professional concept for decision support is developed as the main component of the work. The conceptual focal points are then implemented prototypically using real data and evaluated in the framework of several workshops with professional users.

Convergence of Value-Oriented Indicators and IFRS Financial Reporting Information ¤ Alexander Bantz investigates whether information from IFRS financial reporting is suitable for designing value-oriented indicators in general and specifically for fair value accounting. He shows possibilities and limitations of value-oriented indicators based on fair value and refutes essential criticism points in convergence considerations. To this end, he analyzes whether convergence potential can be recognized in terms of the accounting purposes pursued with value-oriented indicators and information from IFRS financial reporting and the associated requirements. Furthermore, the convergence potential of fair value accounting is examined under special consideration of the regulations of IFRS 13 in terms of behavioral control in investment decisions through various scenarios.

Design and characterization of highly-efficient GaN-HEMTs for power applications ¤ BEGIN<br>Abstract: The excellent physical properties of the semiconductor Gallium nitride (GaN) and the AlGaN/GaN heterostructures based on it are particularly suitable for processing power electronic components. The high breakdown field of GaN in combination with the high electrical conductivity of a polarization-induced two-dimensional electron gas enables the development of transistors with high blocking voltage, small on-resistance, and small switching charges. While material properties and technologies are continuously improved, progress should also be made in device design. <br>This work aims to make the enormous potential of this technology usable by new approaches in the design and characterization of highly efficient GaN transistors. <br>To this end, „High-Electron-Mobility Transistors” (HEMTs) are investigated in their operating states and their behavior in relation to their device structure is analyzed. This results in new approaches for the design of these power components, which are presented here. <br>A focus is on the area-efficient design of very low-ohmic GaN components. Based on an analytical model, construction methods for the development of highly efficient GaN-HEMTs are derived. In addition to the design of interdigital comb structures, new layouts for very large-area components are presented. The layouts are inspired by natural flow systems, such as a fractal comb structure or a cloverleaf structure.<br>In many power electronic applications, the reverse conduction state is also relevant. Since GaN-HEMTs do not contain intrinsic „body diodes”, the behavior differs significantly from conventional power transistors. This work investigates the reverse conduction behavior of a conventional HEMT structure and presents a new, improved HEMT structure with integrated freewheeling diode.<br>END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035235-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375592-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211873-6>
Quantification of the Effects of Road Traffic on Particulate and Nitrogen Oxide Emissions ¤ Against the background of frequent exceedance of emission limits for particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, restrictive measures for urban road traffic, which is considered a main contributor to the burden of these pollutants, are often planned and implemented. This work deals with the effects of traffic control measures, which can influence traffic flow, traffic demand, and traffic composition. However, quantifying the emission-related effects of the aforementioned traffic parameters is difficult: current models often show deviations from measured values in the order of 20 to 40 percent due to complex cause-and-effect relationships, but also due to inaccurate and/or strongly aggregated input data. With a predicted reduction potential of individual traffic control measures in the single-digit to low two-digit percentage range, an optimal selection and design of measures through dynamic, environment-dependent traffic control appears to be only limitedly possible. Within the research project AMONES - Application and Analysis of Model-Based Network Control Procedures in Urban Street Networks, the complex of topics was examined in more detail ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153891-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057516-0>
Growth and Characterization of InSb-Nanowire Structures ¤ III-V semiconductors; nanowires; Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS); Vapor-Solid-Solid (VSS); epitaxial growth; Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE); electron microscopy; heterostructures This work is concerned with the growth of InSb nanowires using Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE). Utilizing a self-developed growth system, the growth behavior of the InSb nanowires is first determined, followed by the examination of the cultivated structures with respect to their morphology, structural composition, and physical properties. The synthesized nanowires were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Essential results of the investigations are: i) The planar defect density within the nanowires can be influenced by the growth temperature. ii) The change of the mass flow ratio of the precursor materials suppresses parasitic layer growth, as well as radial growth of the nanowires. iii) By using suitable growth parameters, radial InSb-GaSb-heterostructures were generated and characterized. iv) Both individual nanowires and large-area ordered nanowire fields were contacted and electrically measured using lithographic processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4707308-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152545-0>
Neuronal regeneration in the olfactory system of locusts ¤ Neuronal regeneration in invertebrates is extensively studied. For this work, I have chosen Locusta migratoria as a model organism to describe the neuronal regeneration of the olfactory system on a morphological and functional level. After deafferentation of the antennal nerve (AN), the size changes in the antennal lobes (AL) are observed. Within 4 days after crushing (dpc: days post crush), the AL of adult locusts and larvae from the 5th larval stage (L5) reach their minimum size and grow again afterwards. By marking the AN with Neurobiotin, it can be shown that this is caused by Wallerian degeneration. Within 24 hours after deafferentation, the distal parts of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) disappear completely. Then, the ORN grow out towards the AL and form synapses with local interneurons and projection neurons (PN). The glomeruli belonging to an ORN are usually circularly arranged. This pattern is not restored after regeneration, instead, the ORN form synapses with random glomeruli. There is a weak correlation between the origin of the ORN in the antenna and the position of the corresponding synapses in the AL, where the ORN from the oldest annuli mainly innervate the 50% - 70% area of the AL neuropil. The fluorescence intensity of the Fasciclin I marking is used to quantify the time frame of ORN regeneration in the AL of adult animals and L5. The AL of treated and untreated adult animals are no longer distinguishable after 10 dpc. Since the L5 had completed their last molt after 8 days, the experiments were terminated at that time, however, the AL of treated animals at that time already looked very similar to those of untreated animals. The analysis of immunofluorescence in the lateral area of the AL shows a significant decrease in L5 with a minimum value after 2 dpc, followed by an increase back to the control level within 7 dpc. In adult animals, the immunofluorescence reaches its minimum after 4 dpc and the control level after 7 dpc. In the medial area of the AL, the immunofluorescence reaches its minimum in adult animals and L5 after 4 dpc. In adult animals, the control level is reached after 10 dpc, in L5 already after 7 dpc. The PN of the AL begin to respond to odor stimuli within 4-7 dpc. Young adult locusts, whose AN was crushed in the L5 stage, reach the control level faster. The response types (excitatory, inhibitory, composite response) usually occur in a fixed ratio to each other. This ratio is disturbed at the beginning of regeneration, but is restored within 21 dpc. First local field potentials (LFPs) can already be measured in the mushroom body (MB) after 4 dpc and after 7 dpc, the odor-induced oscillations are also restored. The olfactory system of the locust regenerates quickly, precisely, and reaches a functional grade similar to the normal state within 21 days after treatment. Whether the ability to identify and distinguish odors is fully restored remains to be proven by behavioral experiments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156903-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177387-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153192-9>
New Titan Catalysts for Hydroamination and Hydroaminoalkylation Reactions for the Generation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Structure Motifs ¤ The use of a mono(aminopyridinato) titanium catalyst for the hydroaminoalkylation of styrene with N-methylaniline provided the branched and the linear product in a ratio of 90:10. Additionally, it was possible to use the mono(aminopyridinato) titanium catalyst in the intermolecular as well as intramolecular hydroamination of alkynes and alkenes with great success. The synthesis of corresponding mono(amidate) titanium complexes was executed as well. Moreover, a variety of amidines and guanidines were synthesized and used as ligand precursors in titanium-catalyzed hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation reactions. A mono(formamidinato) titanium catalyst was then utilized for the implementation of allylamines, allylsilanes and vinylsilanes as substrates. The combination of this reaction with the Buchwald-Hartwig amination to an elegant one-pot procedure finally led to pharmaceutically relevant structure motifs.

Development of an Engineering Model for the Evaluation of the Out-of-Plane Load-Carrying Capacity of Unreinforced Masonry Walls Subjected to Earthquake Loading ¤ Masonry must withstand loads perpendicular to the plane (out-of-plane), e.g. due to earthquakes, in addition to vertical and horizontal loads in the plane. The out-of-plane behavior of unreinforced masonry walls depends on the used stone-mortar combination and is very complex due to strong nonlinearity. Current assessment procedures in German standards are not explicitly developed for out-of-plane behavior and contain significant conservativities in part. Detailed investigations on typical masonry types in Germany do not exist so far.In the framework of the present work, the out-of-plane behavior of singly spanned unreinforced masonry walls was investigated analytically and experimentally. The goal was the development of a model for the description of the out-of-plane vibration behavior of masonry walls.The existing procedures for determining the out-of-plane load-carrying capacity from literature and standards were analyzed. By comparing with nonlinear, numerical simulations, the essential influencing factors were identified. In subsequent shake table tests with insulating brick masonry and porous concrete masonry, these factors were experimentally verified.As a crucial parameter, the vertical stiffness at the wall head due to the underlying frame, supports or ceilings has emerged. Since these cannot be considered in previous procedures, an engineering model was derived that takes this parameter into account. In subsequent tests, the developed model was verified and further investigations on vibration and damping behavior were carried out. In final sensitivity and correlation analyses, the relationship between earthquake parameters and wall displacement was investigated. On this basis, a design model for the considered masonry walls was proposed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038031-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064516-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060581-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180569-0>
The Best of Two Divergent Work Worlds: An Analysis of Individual Career Trajectories and Concepts of People in a Dual Career under the Inclusion of the Self-Determination Theory ¤ An indicator of the change in individual careers is the increasing number of people who engage in more than one professional activity. This phenomenon is addressed by the present work through the examination of narrative interviews of dual career individuals. The focus is on the analysis of research questions, why individuals voluntarily engage in two occupations simultaneously and how they conceive their career. The results show that the career concept of self-determined dual career is related to the satisfaction of work-related needs and can enable the optimization of these needs. These findings partially support the concepts of the new career idea and reflect the three psychological basic needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The integration of this motivation theory into the present analysis also confirms a fruitful and enlightening interdisciplinary connection between SDT and career research. Furthermore, the widespread understanding of career as a sequential sequence of professional experiences is expanded by the dimension of simultaneity and is discussed accordingly.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003974-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293785-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4365362-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4388391-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132063-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073274-5>
Electronic Press and Citizen Journalism: Press Law Rights and Obligations of Word Media on the Internet ¤ The numerous publication options of the Internet enable every Internet user to engage in citizen journalism occasionally and randomly, but also regularly. The work inquires into how this is to be legally classified. Initially, the conventional press concept and its historical development are comprehensively examined to see in which ways offers of electronic press can be included in the scope of press freedom. Subsequently, a new press concept is developed, combining old and new criteria in order to better meet the technical development. Finally, existing press law rights and obligations of the printed press are analyzed in detail to see in which ways they can be transferred to the electronic press. In addition, the press law peculiarities of the electronic press are presented, which have no equivalent in the printed press, as they are purely internet-specific.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038463-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008764-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4514269-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028781-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047171-8>
Economic Analysis of Automated Management of Unstructured Data in Information Lifecycle Management ¤ The goal of Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) is the classification and cost-effective management of information. Information frequently accessed in a company can be separated from information with lower access frequencies and made available and managed on the most suitable storage medium according to corporate requirements. Rapid data growth, high storage, administration, and operating costs, as well as numerous legal requirements are the essential reasons for the emergence of ILM. To analyze the cost-benefit ratio that arises from the implementation and application of ILM, a procedure for the economic analysis of unstructured data management in ILM is constructed, implemented, demonstrated, and evaluated in this work. Classification, migration, and cost functions are implemented to simulate and evaluate the creation of costs and cost-saving potentials for different usage levels of information. It is investigated how the automated classification and management of varying amounts of data with varying access frequencies and usage levels affect the economic efficiency of ILM. In addition to internal corporate storage media, the management of data in Cloud Computing is included in the considerations. The present work provides a literature analysis of the concepts ILM and Cloud Computing as well as a scientific contribution to discuss both legal, functional, and technical requirements for ILM and Cloud Computing. The work ends with a summary and a critical evaluation of the results. A look ahead provides hints and suggestions for improvement regarding the economic analysis of unstructured data in Information Lifecycle Management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066426-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215791-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011168-4>
Informationspraxen in der Bildungsforschung : ethnographic information research on research environments, apparatuses, and research data in interaction ¤ How are data used in educational research or, put differently, how are data turned into research data with corresponding assertiveness for the relevant research question and thus into relevant information in research practice? To address this question, information practices in five different educational research projects are ethnographically investigated, described, and contrasted. This shows how these research projects are enabled to pursue their respective research questions through the production, use, and re-configuration of apparatuses, materials, and data in interaction with an object of investigation. In this work, therefore, less emphasis is placed – as is often the case in information science – on the end product of scientific work, the scientific publication, as the focus of knowledge interest. Instead, information practices, especially interactions in the production and use of research data in their contexts, are assigned a primary position in research interest, without, however, neglecting publications. Publications are considered here – just like other entities – as part of the interaction context to be investigated, through which educational research takes place.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115646-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1098579690> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122926-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066611-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395695-6>
New Experimental Designs on Natural Substances in Chemistry Lessons: Chemistry with Fungi ¤ Jan-Markus Teuscher presents his dissertation with a curriculum development work, which, using the extremely interesting fungi from a chemical perspective, has developed a wide range of and attractive new experimental possibilities for chemistry lessons to promote interest and motivation of students in this subject. The introductory chapters include a brief overview of the biological-mycological basics, a more comprehensive summary of knowledge on the chemistry of fungi, as well as a summarizing and evaluating overview of the already published works on the complex of fungi in biology and chemistry lessons. The experiments described in detail in the main part of the work were tested by students and students. The experiment sets were compiled in a richly illustrated guide for teachers and students, the material book, and can be used immediately in chemistry lessons and in interdisciplinary projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046076-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041418-8>
Cityscape in Transition : Publicity and Cologne Buildings 1763 - 1814 ¤ Revolution and secularization triggered around 1800 one of the greatest loss waves in architectural history. At the same time, the view on historical buildings changed in the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism. The real upheaval and the new perspective are treated as an example of Cologne, a city with rich architecture and a multifaceted public. - - As the public discussion on the protection of endangered buildings and their inventories contributed, so did the discussion of church and urban buildings provide important spaces for political criticism. The present study describes the discussion about historical buildings as an example of Cologne. In the Middle Ages and at the beginning of modern times, the largest city in Germany, a trade center and a church metropolis, Cologne had a unique architectural inventory. As a press city, seat of a university - and station of European educational travelers, Cologne was also a hub of national and international communication. Comparisons with Paris, Mainz and other cities complement the investigation. The study also crosses, which rarely happens, the caesuras 1789/1799 and compares the Enlightenment era, the revolutionary decade and the Napoleonic era. - - Facets-rich and differentiated insights through the combination of urban, intellectual and art historical analyses	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043183-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112681-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137492-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033581-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020526-5>

Indigenous Resistance : the Resistance of the Bolivian TIPNIS Movement ¤ Blurb: Latin America is home to numerous protest movements of its indigenous population. One of the most emblematic cases is the social movement against a prestige project of the Morales government: the construction of a road in the indigenous territory and national park Isiboro Sécure (TIPNIS) in the Bolivian Amazon region. From the perspectives of the heterogeneous protest actors, Maximilian Held reconstructs this resistance in its complex forms. In doing so, he highlights how problems of weakened indigenous self-government, socio-ecological threats, deficits of the neo-extractive development model, and inadequate legal implementation are interconnected.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079262-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187207-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054442-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057887-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055707-8>
Trends of Urban Open Space Development in Politics and Administration ¤ From the introduction: The focus of this study lies in the field of urban green space departments, which have been hardly made into a research subject from the side of landscape planning so far. It is mainly about the level of awareness of the actors, who significantly design and implement municipal open space planning in the city council and in the city administration. In particular, the question should be pursued, which perspectives and opportunities arise from the awareness level of the actors for the urban green administrations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022309-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135789-9>
Static and Dynamic Oligopoly Models : A Contribution to Decision Theory in Oligopol Situations ¤ All considerations in this work are business-oriented, thus being carried out from the point of view of the enterprise. Therefore, the central point of interest is the question of what price a company must set in an oligopol situation, taking into account the given data constellation, in order to behave in accordance with its objectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138606-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043484-9>
Atomistic simulation of dealloying-made microstructures ¤ This thesis explores the evolution of these microstructural features: residual silver, characteristic length scale, and topological connectivity in nanoporous gold (NPG). Kinetic Monte Carlo was used to simulate the dealloying and coarsening processes. Molecular Dynamics was used to simulate the shrinkage process of NPG structures. It is found that the dealloying occurs in two stages. In the primary dealloying, silver clusters are embedded in the ligaments; in the secondary dealloying, the number of silver clusters is reduced. The silver cluster size retains constant during the whole dealloying and scales with the initial ligament size established in the primary dealloying. The finding of coarsening law provides a conclusive confirmation for scattered experimental results. This thesis points out that the solid fraction plays a significant role in the evolution of the nanoporous network’s connectivity during the dealloying, coarsening and shrinkage processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035035-6>

Written Location Determinations in Arithmetic Instruction: An Investigation Based on Content-Related Competencies ¤ For several years, there has been a demand to adjust mathematics instruction to individual competencies and deficits of students. In order to implement this demand in the reality of instruction, it must be concretized in a subject- and content-related manner. Julia Voßmeier takes up the concept of so-called location determinations and investigates how the knowledge gained through written location determinations about individual learning status can be used by both teachers and students in the classroom and for further learning process. Based on an investigation with 600 students from school years 2 to 4 as well as their teachers, she shows that the potential of location determinations has been recognized, but not always fully exploited.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077202-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002919-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8>
Bypassing of path-blocking proteins on microtubules in kinesin-mediated cargo transport ¤ Kinesins are microtubule-associated motor proteins that convert the chemical energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into movement energy to support intracellular transport processes. It is generally accepted that kinesin movement along a single protofilament is the thermodynamically preferred transport mechanism. Kinesin-mediated transport in the intracellular matrix is subject to complex mechanisms, in which a variety of associated cell components or other proteins can interact with the motor proteins and limit their binding to the microtubule surface. Ultimately, this can lead to the cessation of transport processes. The present dissertation describes the transport of kinesin-complexed gold spheres along immobilized microtubules, whose surface has irreversibly bound blocking proteins that compete with the transporter protein for binding sites. To exactly block the binding site of the transporting kinesin on the microtubule, kinesin constructs of different lengths were chosen as obstacles. In the presence of protein blockades, it was observed that the kinesin did not move continuously like in the corresponding control experiments, but that phases of active transport alternated with rest phases. In general, transport was continued after rest pauses, without the kinesin detaching from the microtubule. This behavior suggests that the transporting kinesin is able to bypass irreversibly bound obstacles in the presence of ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236029-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169864-2>
Mindfulness as Cultural Practice: On the Self-World Models of a Popular Phenomenon ¤ Mindfulness has gained an astonishing popularity over the last 50 years - driven by blooming promises and accompanied by blanket criticism. Jacob Schmidt's analysis of various approaches - such as Jon Kabat-Zinn's developed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) - shows, however, that mindfulness practices model quite different self- and world relations. These do not only go back to Buddhist meditation practices, but can be reconstructed as complex entanglements with the culture of modernity and the acceleration society. This presents the first comprehensive and systematic sociological study of the popular phenomenon of mindfulness.

On the Influence of Context-Dependent Quality Parameters on the Perception of Externalization and Sound Event Location ¤ This work encompasses my research activities in the field of spatial hearing. It addresses the question of which effects various contextual influences have on the formation of an auditory illusion. These effects are quantitatively measured. The perception of externalization, sound event location, etc. is investigated using a binaural synthesis system. The goal is to describe and make measurable the contextual influences of divergence, personalization, and visual features. My own investigations clearly show that for the occurrence of a so-called perfect auditory illusion, a sufficient technical realization of the correct ear signals is not sufficient. Rather, fulfillment of the intrinsic expectation of the listener is necessary. The process of quality formation can be described by a comparison and evaluation process. Here, the quality features derived from the stimuli received by the senses are compared with the derived features of an internal, individual reference. This process is decisive for the formation of a sound event. Using quality-assessing surveys (listening tests), this sound event can be made measurable and describable as an image. The results of my work show that a divergence of acoustic space parameters between a binaurally synthesized scene and the listening room leads to a significant reduction in the externalization of sound events. A convergence of acoustic space parameters increases the perceived externalization. The visibility of, for example, loudspeaker dummies in the listening room increases overall externalization. The so-called divergence effect of space cannot be resolved in this way. Personalization of a binaural synthesis system shows a reduction in localization errors and an increase in externalization. The hypothesis is set up and investigated as to whether localization errors and externalization correlate. It will be shown that a personalized binaural synthesis cannot resolve the divergence effect of space. The investigations on the divergence effect of space serve as a basis for the development of methods that change various time- and energy-based acoustic features of the used room impulse responses. The goal is to adapt individual acoustic space parameters of the synthesis to the room acoustics of the listening room to produce a plausible auditory illusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153414-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7859426-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141199-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176198-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322451-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145556-3>
Models for mexican temperate forests : a sustainable management approach ¤ In Mexico there is a need for technologies that link forest stand dynamics with silviculture systems. Providing these technologies could enhance forest management, not only by making forests more profitable, but by adapting them to climate change. Lately, there has been a debate on forest management for carbon and climate change benefits. Recent studies claim that letting forest grow without management is better for carbon sequestration and storage. However, other researchers argue that harvesting is a better management strategy because of the substitution effects of using wood products in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the use of wood products could reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The results of these studies are, however, controversial and further research is required to better understand the impacts of forest management on climate change. This work aims to contribute to the solution of this question and evaluate the results of the studies to give recommendations for sustainable forest management in Mexico. The work consists of three parts: In the first part, the results of the studies are evaluated and the impacts of forest management on climate change are discussed. In the second part, the results of the studies are evaluated and the impacts of forest management on carbon sequestration and storage are discussed. In the third part, the results of the studies are evaluated and the impacts of forest management on greenhouse gas emissions are discussed. This work aims to contribute to the solution of the question of how forest management in Mexico can be sustainably designed to minimize the impacts of climate change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064354-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282537-4>
Angle-sensitive MRI for non-invasive analysis of loaded cartilage structure ¤ Osteoarthritis is caused by degenerative changes in the joint cartilage. In late stages of the disease, arthrotic changes are almost always irreversible. Only targeted therapeutic measures against early osteoarthritis can halt this progressive pathological development. However, there are currently no established non-invasive methods for early osteoarthritis diagnosis in joint cartilage. Conventional clinical magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) can represent soft tissue non-invasively, but due to technical limitations, it is hardly suitable for detecting early arthrotic changes. An extended method - angle-sensitive MRI (AS-MRI) - is based on the orientation dependence of T2 relaxation in MR imaging and offers the possibility of obtaining information about the collagen matrix structure of joint cartilage using an analytical model. Since osteoarthritis affects the organized ultrastructure of joint cartilage, its biomechanical properties and the deformation behavior of the collagen matrix also change under continuous physiological loading. If these barely perceptible changes are recognized, early osteoarthritis stages could be detected. Therefore, the studies on pressure-induced deformation of cartilage structure in this work are based on AS-MRI. For this purpose, untreated cartilage samples from sheep knees were taken and examined under pressure loading in a high-resolution 7T MRI. In the experiments, a procedure modification was made, which was characterized by pressure distribution on the entire sample surface with the help of quickly hardening acrylic resin. This not only allowed the elastic mechanical properties of the tissue to be obtained, but also the pressure-induced inclination of collagen fibers to be quantitatively recorded. These data served the detailed observation of matrix deformation, including the phenomenon of wave formation in fiber form under pressure loading. The gained knowledge was used for the AS-MRI analysis of signal intensity with the aim of evaluating the possibilities of this method for clinical practice. This analysis showed a good agreement of the modeled intensities with the experimentally read data. The result offers good prospects for solving an inverse problem: The pressure-induced matrix deformation could be clarified alone by considering the signal intensity in an MRI loading test. However, this requires further studies, especially basic studies on native and loaded cartilage in vivo.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164652-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156450-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196812-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171740-5>
Design, Synthesis and Properties of Pyrene-Fused Azaacenes and Their Applications in Organic Electronics ¤ Abstract: This thesis is mainly based on synthesis of pyrene-fused azaacenes. Based on the synthesis and properties of obtained azaacenes, the thesis has been divided into five sections as follow. 1) Small molecules for organic electronics: This chapter contains brief introduction of organic electronic devices such as Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs), Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) and Orgainc Photovoltaics (OPVs). As well as the role of small molecules i.e. acenes in the organic electronic has been briefly explained. 2) Design, synthesis and properties of pyrene fused azaacenes: The objective of this project was to develop a new method for the synthesis of ultralong and discrete pyrene-fused azaacenes to overcome all the aspects related to their synthesis and solubility. Such novel methodology is based on the synthesis of a series of charged and uncharged building blocks with solubilising groups that can be assembled in a cyclic proccess to yield pyrene-fused azaacenes, facilitating their synthesis and enhancing their semiconducting properties, solubility and processability. Due to the lack of solubility azaacenes only upto seven fused aromatic rings i. e. “heptacene” was synthesized and characterized. 3) Design, synthesis and properties of versatile 2,7-substituted pyrene fused azaacenes as low LUMO materials for OPV: In this project new synthetic route has been developed following which it was possible to synthesize pyrene fused azaacenes with variety of substitutions on the 2,7 position of pyrene. Following the route synthesis of pyrene fused “hexacenes” and “octacenes” was carried out and their electrochemical and photophysical properties were studied. This route was further utilized for synthesis of low LUMO material, designed with simple cyclocondensation protocol. In order to lower the LUMO, diamines with electron withdrawing groups were used. Obtained low LUMO material has been utilized for organic photovoltaic device. 4) Synthesis and properties of “twisted” pyrene fused azaacenes: In this project synthesis of twistacenes has been carried out using easy synthetic protocol. The synthetic scheme was based on cyclocondensation of substituted o-phenylenediamine with 2,7-substituted pyrene tetraketone. The respective substitutions on damine and tetraketone moieties was carried out by Sonogashira coupling that provided rigidity as well as the substitutents were posed away from core that avoided electronic int ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176461-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141230-8>

Mobile Daily Life in the Context of Changing Gender Relations ¤ For a period of over 30 years, Kathrin Konrad charts the essential trends in the daily mobility of men and women, assigns these trends to the change of norms and gender relations, and closes a research gap in the field of gender and mobility through her comprehensive consideration of traffic behavior and its framework conditions. The quantitative study takes into account the social diversity of society and the spatial context as a framework for daily mobility in gender relations through complex regression models. Both daily mobility itself and its framework conditions change significantly for men and women over the observation period – partly to a very different extent depending on the social and spatial environment. While many behavioral differences between men and women disappear over time in some population groups, some differences in certain dimensions of daily mobility and in individual groups are still persistent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076600-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062987-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071781-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187820-6>

Influence of Formulation and Process on Adhesion Behavior in Multi-Component Injection Moulding of Thermoplastic Elastomer Composite Parts - Example PA6.6 - HNBR ¤ The combined use of two or more materials in one composite part is nowadays necessary for the product development of polymer parts in order to get an integration of function and design. Furthermore, a growing cost pressure enforces a reduction of production steps, e.g. realized by multi-component injection moulding. Especially the automotive engineering turns his attention for the integration of sealing and damping functions as well as for weight reduction to composite parts made of a hard thermoplastic and a soft rubber material. To ensure an everlasting operation of such composite parts, a strong adhesion between these components is necessary. This thesis deals precisely with the direct material bonding of thermoplastics and peroxide cross-linked rubbers. Using the combination PA6.6 and HNBR, the influence of rubber compound ingredients and process parameters on the adhesion strength is determined and evaluated based on analytical results. Additionally, by using basic rubber compounds and simplifying boundary conditions conclusions on the bonding mechanisms can be drawn.

Searching for runaway stars in twelve Galactic supernova remnants ¤ Runaway stars move faster than typical field stars. They can either be released through dynamic interactions in dense stellar systems or through supernovae in multiple star systems. In this work, young runaway stars are to be identified that are located within the remnants of core-collapse supernovae. A connection to a runaway star yields the exact time and place of the supernova as well as the parameters of the previous binary system. This also yields insights into the kinematics of a supernova and the expansion of a supernova remnant. Previous works have mainly dealt with massive runaway stars, as these are always young (less than about 32 million years, maximum age of the progenitor star), and easier to find. We are looking for low-mass runaway stars, however, in order to limit their share of all runaway stars. With Gaia data, runaway candidates were identified in twelve nearby supernova remnants. With the VLT and the Subaru telescope, spectra of 39 candidates were taken to search, for example, for the lithium absorption line at 671 nm, which can be used as an indicator of a low age for stars of spectral classes F, G, K, and M. Lithium was found in the spectra of eleven stars, but no candidate could be confirmed as a runaway star from a core-collapse supernova. We show the spectral analysis with measurements of radial velocity, atmospheric parameters, and lithium content. Using the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the lithium test, we estimate the age of the observed stars. Then we present a selection of promising runaway candidates from Gaia data, discuss our results for the individual supernova remnants, and limit the number of released runaway stars compared to model calculations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057342-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204838-2>
Potentials and limits of genomics-assisted wheat breeding ¤ Wheat yield needs to be doubled to feed 9 billion people by 2050. The goal of this thesis was to study the potential and limits of marker-assisted and genomic selection for enhancing yield, as well as resistances to Fusarium head blight and Septoriatritici blotch. The association mapping study in combination with different validation strategies revealed that all three traits were complex approximating the infinitesimal model. The complex genetic architecture limits the use of marker-assisted selection. In contrast, genomic selection allows predicting precisely all three examined traits. Contrasting different genomic selection models suggested that epistasis contributed to the phenotypic variation. Relatedness drives the prediction accuracy of genomic selection. Applying the reliability criterion facilitates to exploit relatedness very efficient by estimating the prediction accuracy of individual genotypes.

Model-Based Operation Strategy for PEM Fuel Cell Systems ¤ Modeling -- Interaction analysis of operating relevant parameters -- Development methodology of the operation strategy -- Proof of function and evaluation of the methodology.

Highly Qualified Immigration : The Blue Card Directive 2009/50/EC and its Implementation in Germany ¤ Germany and also the other EU member states are confronted with a growing shortage of highly qualified individuals. Traditional immigration countries like the USA, Canada or Australia introduced significantly more flexible admission requirements for highly qualified individuals in the past. In order to make the EU more attractive for highly qualified individuals from third countries and thus ensure competitiveness and economic growth, the same conditions should be created at EU level through the Blue Card Directive to facilitate the immigration of highly qualified workers. The author provides a careful legal analysis of the Blue Card Directive and the German implementation law (Law on the Implementation of the Highly Qualified Workers Directive of the European Union). The work has a high practical value, as it thoroughly deals with the interpretation and compatibility questions of the Blue Card Directive and the German implementation law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7>
Development and Application of Sparse Coding Methods for the Analysis of Arm Movement Trajectories ¤ One of many modalities for conveying information in human-machine interaction is gesture. With the help of dynamic gestures, both concepts and emotions can be communicated. In this work, the temporal course of the position of a limb during the execution of the gesture, known as the movement trajectory, is considered. In order for a machine to perceive gestures, the trajectories must be captured using sensors and then interpreted through corresponding data processing. A multi-stage pattern recognition process is used in this case. One step in this process is feature extraction, which presents the captured signal in a compact form. This work is devoted to an investigation of the application of sparse coding in feature extraction for movement trajectories. Sparse coding can represent a data set through a limited number of representative, recurring features. These features are learned from training data in a learning phase and detected in an unknown signal in the recognition phase. This concept has the advantage over conventional methods for feature extraction in temporal signals that the features are optimally adapted to the data and thus describe the characteristic properties of the training data. In this work, the procedure is optimized for application to movement trajectories. It is investigated under which conditions sparse coding is applicable to movement trajectories and how the captured data must be preprocessed. Furthermore, the effects of the procedure on subsequent processing steps in the pattern recognition process, such as classification and generation of movement trajectories, are considered. The performance of the procedure in the use of gesture recognition is demonstrated in experiments using a dataset created within the scope of this work. To investigate the generalizability of the procedure to other application domains, it is applied to benchmark datasets from the areas of activity recognition and handwriting recognition. Furthermore, a real-time implementation of the procedure is presented in a demonstrator application.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4610668-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314440-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208631-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157147-2>
Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Response after Long-Term Supplementation of Conjugated Linoleic Acids in Lactating Dairy Cows ¤ Insulin resistance, CLA, cows. - Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), used in dairy cows as feed supplements, have been suspected to lead to insulin resistance in studies on rodents and humans. It is assumed that a reduction in insulin sensitivity in dairy cows plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as increased lipomobilization, ketosis, and liver fat accumulation. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp (HEC) is the gold standard for demonstrating insulin resistance. It allows the distinction between reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin response when consecutive, increasing insulin infusion concentrations are used. However, the HEC is only suitable for studies with small sample sizes due to its high cost and labor requirements. Therefore, various alternative indices, such as the Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in various modifications, have been developed in human medicine for simple determination of insulin sensitivity. These indices are based on the plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and glycerol in fasting subjects. Considering the differences between the regulatory mechanisms for maintaining glucose homeostasis in humans and ruminants, the direct transfer of these indices to dairy cows is not possible. Therefore, it is necessary to determine insulin sensitivity in dairy cows with specific methods. This work aims to investigate insulin sensitivity and insulin response after long-term supplementation of conjugated linoleic acids in lactating dairy cows. The results of this work are intended to show the effects of CLA on insulin sensitivity and insulin response in dairy cows and discuss the possible consequences for the health of these animals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234712-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163674-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4829176-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166486-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169916-6>

OFDM-based MIMO Channel Measurements with Various Antennas ¤ This work deals with the measurement and evaluation of the channels of modern multiple-antenna wireless systems (English: multiple input multiple output, abbreviated MIMO). In this context, MIMO transmissions are carried out inside an aircraft and in a typical office environment. Based on some channel parameters, the influence of the aircraft cabin on MIMO wireless transmission is evaluated in comparison to the office environment. The channel is determined in the frequency range using pilot sequences and the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing method (OFDM). The used MIMO system is presented in detail. Then, the used algorithms are addressed and techniques for reducing the crest factor in MIMO-OFDM systems are investigated. Furthermore, the results of the channel measurements are presented and discussed.

Characterization of the Transcription Factor CcpN from Bacillus subtilis ¤ Catabolite repression, the ability to shut off non-essential alternative metabolic pathways in the presence of a preferred nutrient source, is an important property of numerous bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, this task is taken over by the transcription factor CcpN, which can repress the transcription of the genes gapB, pckA, and sr1. In the framework of this work, the recently identified transcription factor was thoroughly investigated. It could be shown that CcpN occupies two operators at each of the three mentioned promoters and cooperatively binds to them. Furthermore, ATP and acidic pH were identified as activators and ADP as a repressor of CcpN activity using in vitro transcription experiments and CD spectroscopy. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of repression by CcpN at the three mentioned promoters was elucidated. It was shown that CcpN can bind to all promoters together with the RNA polymerase and also allows the formation of an open complex. Finally, CcpN was identified as a new, previously unknown target of CcpN and it was shown that CcpN can act as an activator there. In summary, the mode of action of CcpN was presented in detail using a comprehensive model and thus an important contribution to the understanding of catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis was made.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4303350-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242465-3>

Chance statt Show - Citizen Participation with Virtual Reality & Co. : Acceptance and Effect of the Visualization of Building Projects ¤ With classical plan documents or montage images, ordinary citizens can hardly assess the benefits and effects of building projects. Today, realistic and freely experienced 3D models enable spectacular applications, in which the viewer is completely immersed in the plans as if they were already realized. Arne Spieker formulates requirements for the use in citizen participation in building projects and examines the acceptance and effect of different visualization technologies among citizens.

Characterization of Influencing Factors on SERS Spectra of Low-Molecular Substances and Medical Relevant Applications of the LOC-SERS System ¤ The combination of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) system is a promising analytical approach for medical diagnostics. The SERS spectra contain molecular-specific information and enable the detection of molecular systems in the submicromolar range. The LOC-SERS method allows for a high throughput of single samples with low sample volume. Furthermore, the implementation of modules for sample pretreatment is feasible with low technical effort. Within this work, the various possibilities of the microfluidic SERS system are to be shown. By using the LOC-SERS system, the determination of exact measurement conditions and high reproducibility is ensured. In a basic study, the influences on SERS spectra are investigated in this work. Pyridine and monosubstituted pyridine derivatives are used as analytes. It is shown that the inclusion of quantum chemical methods is essential for accurate band assignment. It is demonstrated that quantitative analyses can be performed using LOC-SERS datasets in complex media. The antimetabolite Methotrexate (MTX) is semi-quantitatively detected in aqueous solution and artificial blood plasma, and different concentrations of MTX in real blood plasma can be clearly distinguished. Furthermore, pathogens are identified using chemometric methods based on the SERS spectra of marker molecules. The focus of the work is on the detection of low-molecular substances in complex media, such as blood plasma and bacterial suspension, as well as the identification of pathogenic mycobacteria.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170927-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8>
Quality goal oriented architectural design and traceability for evolvable software systems ¤ Software systems are today confronted with frequent changes due to changing business processes or technologies, for example. The software and especially its architecture must enable these changes for permanent usability. During software evolution, changes can lead to a deterioration of the architecture, architecture erosion. This hinders or prevents further changes due to inconsistency or lack of program understanding. To prevent erosion, quality goals such as evolvability, performance, or usability as well as the traceability of architectural design decisions must be considered. This is often neglected. Existing design methods only insufficiently support the transition from quality goals to suitable architectural solutions due to a gap between methods of requirements engineering and architectural design. This is particularly true for evolvability and the traceability of design decisions through explicit model dependencies. This work presents a new concept, called Goal Solution Scheme, which maps quality goals over architectural principles to solution instruments through explicit dependencies. It thus helps to select architectural solutions corresponding to their influence on quality goals. The schema is specifically discussed with regard to evolvability and is embedded in a goal-oriented approach that improves and integrates established methods and concepts of requirements engineering and architectural design. This is supplemented by a traceability concept that combines a rule-based approach with techniques of information retrieval. This enables the semi-automatic creation of traceability links with specific link types and attributes for a rich semantics as well as high accuracy and hit rate. The realizability of the approach is shown in a case study of a software for mobile service robots. The EMFTrace tool was implemented as an extensible platform based on Eclipse technology to show the applicability of the concepts. It integrates design models from external CASE tools using XML technology in a common model repository, applies rules for link creation, and provides validation functions for rules and links.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501553-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213997-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768065-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121677-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219057-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234163-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4806498-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191911-7>

Surface-Controlled Mineralization of Calcium Phosphate ¤ In the present work, it could be shown that the two used amphiphiles with cholesterol as hydrophobic block, are good templates for the mineralization of calcium phosphate at the water/air interface. By means of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the successful mineralization of calcium phosphate for both amphiphiles at the water/air interface could be proven. It could also be shown that the phase behavior of the two amphiphiles and the crystal phases formed during the mineralization of calcium phosphate are not identical. Both amphiphiles thus exert a different influence on the course of mineralization. At CHOL-HEM, both after 3 h and after 5 h, octacalcium phosphate (OCP) could be proven as the only crystal phase by means of XPS, SAED, HRTEM and EDXS …	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145644-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127567-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1103519999>
Spielerisch selbstbestimmt : rechtskonforme Einwilligungserklärungen in Zeiten ubiquitärer Digitalisierung ¤ Auch nach den Vorgaben der DSGVO ist die Einwilligungserklärung das zentrale Ausübungsinstrument datenschutzrechtlicher Selbstbestimmung. Allerdings wird das Versprechen einer freiwilligen, selbstbestimmten und allem voran informierten Einwilligung im Kontext der voranschreitenden Vernetzung und Verdatung der Gesellschaft vermehrt kritisch beäugt. Gerade aber mit Blick auf die zunehmende Ökonomisierung personenbezogener Daten sollten die Vorgaben des Datenschutzrechts nicht als Antagonist der datengetriebenen Wirtschaft identifiziert werden, sondern vielmehr als Innovationsmotor bei der Ausgestaltung kreativer Einwilligungsprozesse. Vor diesem Hintergrund analysiert die vorliegende Arbeit die nunmehr geltenden grund- und datenschutzrechtlichen Anforderungen an die Einwilligungserklärung und untersucht erste Lösungsansätze zur Gewährleistung einer effektiven, digitalisierten Selbstbestimmung. / »Playfully Self-Determined. Legally Compliant Declarations of Consent in Times of Ubiquitous Digitization« -- Consent is increasingly called into question in the context of digitization.

In view of this, the constitutional and data protection requirements of consent, which are now in force, will be examined. In the course of this, first solution approaches of an effective consent process will be shown not only despite but through digitization.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113402-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173908-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140250-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Hybrid Friction Eutectic Bonding (HFEB) - Material-Interface Bonding of Aluminum and Copper using Eutectic Reaction ¤ Approaches to material lightweighting with the goal of weight and resource optimization in electrical connections have made the joining of aluminum-copper alloys a strongly pursued research focus of the last few years. In the context of electromobility and general increase in comfort and safety standards, high challenges arise for the joining technologies to be used. The target state for electrical connections consists of large-area, ductile connections with low contact resistance. Depending on the process, these goals are however only partially achieved by the formation of brittle, intermetallic phases or increased surface and component deformation. In the present work, the formation of an eutectic melt between aluminum and copper was specifically utilized to utilize the solution space between press and fusion welding processes. While the initial contact of the surfaces is accelerated by the joining pressure during the stir-welding process, the expansion and wetting of the joint area takes place through the formation of an eutectic melt. This forms between the base materials without them passing into the liquid phase. Depending on the process control, the press welding process can be used again here to displace the melt from the joint zone. Thus, the solidification behavior can be targeted, while further advantages arise through the transport of inclusions and impurities. By adapted process control, full-area bonding can be achieved in a short process time of less than 0.5 s. The formation of further brittle phases outside the eutectic system is prevented by limiting the peak temperature and energy input. In addition, the melt formation can be detected as a reduction in material resistance during the force-controlled process and used for further process approaches. Further optimization approaches are shown when transferring to other press welding processes and component geometries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133696-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7554620-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153230-2>
A Rewritten History? : The Hitler Diaries and Their Echo ¤ The scandal surrounding the Hitler Diaries occupied not only the Federal Republic in 1983, but was observed worldwide. The magazine "Stern" had published excerpts from the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler. One claimed the right to interpretation in public that from now on the NS history "would have to be written in large parts anew" and triggered a storm of indignation. Here sets Sebastian Barth's investigation: Adolf Hitler was presented in a derogatory manner in "Stern" as well as in a "Stern-TV" film, and this taboo breach in his historical-cultural and historiographical context as well as its reception in a (history-)politically and journalistically heated situation at the beginning of the 1980s are analyzed in detail.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016247-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061672-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058900-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Development of Polymer Bonding Elements for Timber Construction ¤ The focus of the present work is the constructive development and the scientific investigation of the load-bearing behavior of bonding elements for engineered timber construction. The newly developed connections consist preferably of steel parts with threaded connections and are anchored in the wood with a polymer bonding agent. The bonding elements allow for a simple and mounting-friendly connection of timber components to each other or to other building structures. They take axial tensile or compressive loads and ensure a high-performance and slip-free connection to the wood. For bonding, a mineral-filled epoxy resin with very good adhesive properties against wood and most common building materials is used. In the wood, drill holes are provided for anchoring the bonding elements, which are advantageous both from a technological point of view and for a uniform stress distribution. The diameter of the drill hole is significantly larger than that of the connection element, resulting in an increase in the connection area to the wood at constant length. The enlargement of the gaps between the connection element and the timber cladding from 7 mm to 17 mm leads to an increase in load of over 20% at constant embedment depth and equal diameter of the connection medium. The larger bonding gap also ensures a smoothing of the stresses within the connection, the use of free-formed connection elements, and a simplification of production. The bonding elements are equally suitable for use in tensile or compressive shocks as for stiff connections of axially connected beams or frame corners. They can be provided in the timber component on the production site or bonded directly on the construction site. For practical construction, the use of shrink-free bonding material with high adhesive effect offers a range of applications from tolerance compensation to shear reinforcement to compressive, tensile, or bending connections.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032231-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130462-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025677-7>
From the Highway to the Rail : Military Strategy and Railways in Prussia from 1833 to the Campaign of 1866 ¤ In the middle of the 19th century and as a result of the industrial revolution, the technological change also affected the armies of Europe. Of considerable strategic importance were the new railways, with the help of which the general staffs were able to plan larger troop transports for the first time with precision. Just Prussia was particularly dependent on this revolutionary means of transport due to the exposed location of its provinces. After a brief initial hesitation, the conceptual and organizational prerequisites for the military use of the railway were deliberately created from the end of the thirties. In the war of 1866 against Austria, it was already clear how strategy and warfare had changed through the new mobility.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039305-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014015-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128707-1>

Investigations on dynamic properties of Ionic liquids towards their application as electrolytes ¤ Abstract: This work is concerned with the investigation of transport properties and the synthesis of highly fluorinated ionic liquids (ILs), particularly with a view to a possible application of these ILs in supercapacitors. An extensive comparative study of the dynamic viscosities, electrical conductivities and ion specific diffusion constants of known and new [NTf2]– (Tf = SO2CF3) and [Al(hfip)4]– (hfip = OCH(CF3)2) based ILs showed that [Al(hfip)4]– ILs possess at least comparable and partially even better dynamic properties than the analogous [NTf2]– ILs. An analysis of the diffusion constants with a modified Stokes-Einstein equation (SEE) allowed for a semiquantitative comparison of the interactions in both IL classes. Additionally, the applicability of the original SEE could be falsified. Hirshfeld analyses and the theoretical treatment with a modified Marcus theory proved that [Al(hfip)4]– ILs exhibit considerably lower interactions, leading to higher ionicities and better transport properties. Mixtures of several highly fluorinated ILs were prepared, and viscosities and diffusion constants were determined. Almost all mixtures yielded clear deviations from ideal behavior, which was attributed to the interplay of different kinds of interactions and mass transport via holes within the ILs. The mixtures of several [B(hfip)4]–, [Al(hfip)4]– and [NTf2]– ILs with dimethyl carbonate opened another way to further improve the dynamic properties of these substances. An attempt to use [Al(hfip)4]– ILs as electrolytes in supercapacitors was not productive due to a pronounced sieving effect at the electrodes. The utilization of macroporous electrodes lead to a relative improvement compared to [NTf2]– ILs. On an absolute scale, however, no enhancement was found. The synthesis of a new class of ILs based on the [B(tfe)4]– (tfe = OCH2CF3) anion was achieved. Viscosities and melting points of these ILs indicate a possible application as lubricants. For further optimization of the properties of the investigated highly fluorinated ILs, first attempts towards the synthesis of partially fluorinated imidazolium cations were conducted. It could be shown that such syntheses are somewhat intricate but well possible. Viscosities of ILs with such cations are higher than in the case of unfluorinated cations due to reduced entropy. Still, this field is a promising starting point for future improvements, for instance of the stability of ILs	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002145-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548899-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4701310-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151826-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185924-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133806-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043793-0>

Investigation of the Potential for Increasing the Efficiency of Simple Switching Power Supply Topologies and Derivation of Design Guidelines ¤ This work is primarily aimed at developers of switching power supplies, semiconductors, and passive components, who, through a sharpening of their understanding of the overall topology and the underlying relationships, would like to approach the optimal and at the same time simple switching power supply as closely as possible in their daily work. At the beginning of the work, the properties of common switching power supply topologies are first presented and compared with each other. The two circuit types with the lowest complexity grade, Flyback and Forward Converter, are then analyzed in detail theoretically and points for optimization are shown. For this purpose, both the loss-determining properties of active components (power semiconductors, diodes) and passive components (electrolytic capacitors, transformers) are explained. Based on simulations and practical experiments, it is shown how the efficiency can be particularly increased by optimizing transformers and semiconductors. The applicability of the results achieved for developers of switching power supplies is verified at practical constructions and measurements. In the simulations carried out, various parameters of the inductive components and above all the semiconductors are varied, and the resulting influences on the behavior of the circuit are shown. This new approach to synthesizing semiconductors provides both developers of switching power supplies and manufacturers of semiconductors with important information for designing optimally operating DC/DC converters and the required properties on a component level. The simulation models and results used for this purpose are fully contained with corresponding descriptions. In order to guarantee a comprehensive consideration of practical application cases for switching power supplies, PFC stages are also included in the efficiency studies and recommendations for the design of an efficiency-optimized switching power supply overall concept are made. At the end of each section for the investigated topologies, the reader receives concrete assistance and design rules for the construction of a switching power supply with optimized efficiency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165203-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179389-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124127-7>
Decentralized Applications in the Sharing Economy: Market Access, Consumer Protection, Liability ¤ For a long time, blockchain technology was only used as a synonym for Bitcoin. At the same time, the sharing economy became a mass business and the subject of regulatory attention through representatives such as Airbnb und Uber. In the meantime, more and more business models based on blockchain technology are also developing in the sharing economy. It raises the question of regulatory requirements for these businesses. Kai Hindahl examines this question on the basis of examples of decentralized applications	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7737985-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1124028595> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121467-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125820-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117338-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187893-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1068893915>
The Climate Change : Why We Have the Responsibility to Fairly Solve the Emerging Problems and Why We Don't! ¤ What is Justice? How could just regulations look like for the catastrophes and sufferings that climate change triggers or will trigger? These are often unjust because they often hit those who have contributed least to climate change much harder. But what exactly do we understand under the catchword: 'climate change'? And can this really hit people directly? A brief scientific summary clarifies the most important questions here. Since this is a philosophical work, it must first be clarified whether humans can be the cause of something like, for example, global warming. Robert Spaemann's thesis on this is that humans can change the course of the world through their free will with their individual actions. Hans Jonas adds that we are responsible for the intended and unintended consequences of our actions through this ability. With that, it would be from a scientific perspective (1st part of the work) and from a philosophical perspective (beginning of 2nd part) ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078517-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290733-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078520-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1079417915>

Drug Consumption and Control: Establishing a Social Problem in the First Third of the 20th Century ¤ Widespread drug consumption became part of the popular and scientific image of the Weimar Republic: It is said that in the 1920s a 'drug wave' swept across Germany. Annika Hoffmann shows how, at the beginning of the 20th century, the interpretation of non-medical consumption of opiates and cocaine as a social problem was established and what consequences this had for the consumers. The author intensively deals with historical sources and shows in the problematic discourse of contemporaries how the dominant view of drugs developed today and what conclusions can be drawn from it.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140775-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067510-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048610-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000320-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055740-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198658-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065109-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055719-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070587-0>

Gold nanoparticles : microreactor-based synthesis and toxic substance transport effect ¤ BEGIN The goal of this work was to investigate the suitability of microreactors for handling, generating and investigating nanoparticle systems. The developed laboratory setup should be characterized in terms of its suitability for application in a process chain, which includes particle synthesis, modification up to analysis and investigation of the binding of pollutants to nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles (GNP) were selected as a model for a nanoparticle system, as they show very interesting properties that make them suitable for the development of new functional materials in the field of nanotechnology. The potential interactions of GNP with various model substances for pollutants were investigated using conventionally synthesized surface-modified GNP. It was shown that the necessary isolation step, as well as the incubation, were not realizable in any available microsystem. It could be shown that the heavy metal ions lead and copper, as well as the cationic dye malachite green, are very efficiently adsorbed by GNP, while the interaction with 4-chlorophenol, Amidoschwarz B and naphthalene is low. A direct synthesis of GNP from a gold salt and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent in a split-and-recombine microreactor could be realized, which showed that such a direct continuous synthesis in a microreactor is possible. Experimental parameters were optimized to produce narrow particle size distributions. It was shown that the adjustment of the surface properties of the microreactor channels and the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles was crucial to prevent particle deposition, which leads to reactor clogging. Two approaches, namely the hydrophobization of the channel surfaces by silanization and the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles and channel surfaces by increasing the pH value. Furthermore, in a modular microsystem, silver and gold nanoparticles could be produced using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. Additionally, the conversion of these particles with ligands directly in the microsystem was successful, which led to a direct synthesis of modified gold and silver nanoparticles in a continuous process. In summary, it could be shown that nanoparticle systems can be well handled, represented and spectrally analyzed in microsystems. It was also possible to investigate particle growth, ligand binding to the surface and aggregation in the microfluidic system.

Development of a Class Library for Modeling Medical Processes ¤ The increasing cost pressure in Germany has also reached the healthcare sector in recent years, so that all existing processes are brought into focus of process management under consideration of quality and cost characteristics. The modeling of processes in the target domain of medicine is intended to support the development of the class library, which, according to a fixed structuring principle, provides domain-specific process steps for modeling concrete clinical processes. The modeling of the class library is carried out using an adapted modeling cycle. In the first phase, analysis, the peculiarities of the domain of medicine are worked out. Based on the analysis results, the derivation and specification of architectural and domain-specific requirements for the to-be-modeled class library are carried out in the conception. At the end of the conception, the formalization of the requirements is carried out in UML. In the subsequent phase of implementation, the formalized requirements are implemented in Innovator. Starting from the central root class MoBimeP, the separation into process steps and organizational units is carried out, with the classes Ablauforganisation and Aufbauorganisation being modeled via an inheritance relationship to the class MoBimeP. For the elaboration of the class hierarchy, these two subclass classes are further specialized. After the implementation of the class library is completed, the modeling cycle provides the phase of application. For the first application of the class library, the treatment path of the hernia is used. Following the phase of application is the validation. Since this phase is passed for the first time in the context of class library modeling, the validation includes two steps: the testing of the class library against the requirements imposed on it and a description of the procedure for subsequent adaptation of the class library with regard to operations and classes. With the successful validation, the class library is again available for application. According to the modeling cycle, a constant exchange between the phases of application and validation can occur.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304790-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4469781-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032786-3>

Investigations into the Annual Dynamics of a Coal Tit Population ¤ From the introduction: The number of coal tit breeding pairs that occupy certain biotopes annually varies significantly from year to year. The aim of this work is to determine the annual dynamics of a coal tit population in the Schlüchtern-Steinau area (Hesse) from 1972 to 1977. It should be shown, among other things, to what extent migrations (immigration and emigration) take place outside and at the beginning of the breeding season, and how strongly these breeding and winter populations are influenced. In order to achieve this, not only were breeding biological parameters recorded, but through intensive netting at feeding sites and through nocturnal checks of nesting cavities in winter, further important information was compiled. They are intended to show that the time outside the breeding period has been neglected to date and that decisive insights into the annual dynamics can only be achieved through an intensive study of this period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046803-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164600-9>

Investigation of Patient Flow Management in Complex Interdependent Hospitals: Development, Implementation, and Evaluation of Procedures Based on Simulation, Optimization, and Data Mining ¤ Waiting times are the result of inefficient patient flow management. Rather than investing heavily in new capacity, this paper shows approaches to using existing resources to increase patient flow. Hospital-wide overflow rules allow patients to be shifted to other wards to overcome bottlenecks. Flexible resource use can reduce wait times by 96%. Since these findings must be incorporated into patient flow planning, a robust linear optimization model is used to evaluate and adjust, if necessary, an initial schedule for patients. Since not all bottlenecks can be avoided with good planning, a procedure based on patients' medical needs and wards' competencies is developed that suggests alternate wards for individual patients. In this way, almost all remaining bottlenecks are resolved quickly and with high treatment quality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189152-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044903-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043586-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205832-6>

Nanoscopy for DNA Structure Elucidation ¤ The use of metallic or metal-coated measurement probes for scanning probe microscopy (SPM – engl. scanning probe microscopy) is a prerequisite for combining it with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS – engl. surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy). In the procedure referred to as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS – engl. tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy), ideally only the end-standing metal nanoparticle is used for the enhancement of specific Raman information. Due to the limited range of the evanescent field used for detection of the irradiated nanoparticle, extremely small areas can be spectroscopically examined. In this way, single-molecule sensitivity can be achieved, which is simultaneously supported by the topographic information of scanning probe microscopy. The properties of TERS technology thus create the potential for the analysis of individual DNA strands. In the framework of this work, various DNA samples were examined. In this context, numerous questions regarding the primary and secondary structure of DNA were addressed for the first time using TERS. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183788-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070512-2>
Human-Technology Interaction using Free-Space Gestures ¤ With Industry 4.0, human-technology interaction is gaining significant importance. To enable humans and machines to work together, alternative interaction forms need to be developed. Successful communication means that both communication partners have the same information status at the end of the communication. Natural, human communication takes place on different levels (e.g. visually and acoustically), which are to be interpreted together. The accompanying gesture of speech can be well recognized in the interaction between spoken word, executed gesture, and cognitive performance of the recipient. The "green folder over there" requires the recipient to process "green" and "folder" in addition to the purely sensory tasks of hearing and seeing. With all this information, human-human communication with gesture support achieves a recognition rate of almost 100%. If gestures are to be used for human-technology communication, the additional context information is currently not available for technical evaluation. Therefore, descriptions of the gesture were developed and evaluated, with which a total recognition rate of over 85% can be achieved without interpreting the context information. Based on the user understanding - pointing is understood as a static gesture - a technically usable description was developed. This, only evaluating the body pose of pointing, achieves a recognition rate of around 50% in the evaluation. It has already been successfully transferred to practice in the framework of a research project. Based on a phase model of gesture execution, two further descriptions were developed. In these, the entire gesture cycle from introduction, main part, holding phase, and conclusion is considered. With the data of the Kinect 2 used for the evaluation, recognition rates of over 85% could be achieved with the extended phase definitions. For the improvement of the recognition rate, it is necessary in the future to describe further gestures such as "waving" to distinguish them from "pointing". In addition, the target of the pointing gesture must be recognized and checked using the context information.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1072179776> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1048344657> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075376-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264283-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>

Supporting route guidance of car drivers with a tactile display on urban roads ¤ Visual and auditory displays complement each other in presenting turn-by-turn route information in conventional car navigation systems, but may results in driver’s distraction from the primary driving task.In this thesis, we present a tactile car navigation system, which displays turn-by-turn instructions with a vibro-tactile waist belt exploiting a "free" sensory channel. We investigated different tactile parameters such as intensity, duration, and rhythm and designed information presentations for different types of crossings along the route. In different evaluations on urban roads we compared our tactile design with existing car navigation systems measuring performance and cognitive workload of the driver.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4781185-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056783-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184494-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189371-2>
Port Cities in the Eastern Mediterranean from Hellenism to the Roman Empire: Urban Planning, Function, and Perception ¤ Through their location, ancient port cities were important nodes within the Mediterranean-wide communication and thus represented the decisive interfaces between the living spaces of land and water. The investigation deals with the urban development of selected Mediterranean port cities. At the center stands the question of how strongly the location at the coast and the sea influenced the physiognomy and the functional division of a city.

Urban Transformation Processes in Central and Eastern Europe: Urban Development between Growth and Shrinkage, exemplified by Łódź and Gdańsk ¤ Urban transformation processes are associated with profound social and spatial changes in the central and eastern European countries. The development trajectories of many cities are further intensified by increasing globalization, demographic change, and the effects of the financial and economic crisis. Against this backdrop, Anja Erdmann examines the emergence and impact of shrinkage- and growth-related urban development processes in central and eastern European metropolises. Using the two case studies of Łódź and Gdańsk, she also considers the independent and divergent development paths and thus contributes to a differentiated understanding of the urban transformation process.

The Dangers of Networking through Networking: A Critical Examination of the Concept of Organized Crime in the Analog and Digital World ¤ Dangers of Networking through Networking -- Organized Crime in the Analog and Digital World – Criminological Perspective -- Organized Crime in the Analog and Digital World – Legal Perspective -- Conclusion - Function and Value of the Label Organized Crime. This work deals with the dangers of networking through networking. The goal is a critical examination of the concept of Organized Crime in the Analog and Digital World, with the criminological and legal perspectives being illuminated. In order to follow up on the myth surrounding the phenomenon of Organized Crime and to objectify it, the change and significance of social, economic, and criminal networking are first traced and the resulting dangers, particularly through Cybercrime and the relevance for Organized Crime, are shown. Subsequently, the etymology and the concept of Organized Crime in the Analog and Digital World are investigated and discussed from a criminological perspective, in which extent the criminal law is oriented towards the findings, newer forms of appearance such as Cybercrime are included and sharpened by the term Organized Crime. Finally, the function and the value of the label Organized Crime are discussed. The author Nicole Selzer is a research referent and identifies future research topics in the field of cybersecurity in order to initiate corresponding research projects and to design tenders.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043830-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010452-7>
The Subordination of Shareholder Loans in Insolvency in Consortium Financing and Majority of Creditors ¤ When financing is provided by multiple parties, numerous problems arise in connection with the law of shareholder loans, particularly § 39(1)(5) InsO for credit-hungry borrowers. In order to assess the subordination and avoidance risk in the insolvency of the borrowing company as well as possible, clear parameters are required. The author analyzes the susceptibility of credit consortia and creditor majorities on a factual, contractual, and security law level. This is done on the one hand by a scientific examination, particularly of § 39 and § 135 InsO, around the law of shareholder loans in financing by multiple parties. On the other hand, the insights and solution proposals gained are also projected onto practical scenarios and legally evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7692022-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139806-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426210-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072843-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020619-1>
Observation of Structural Changes and Restriction Analysis of Individual DNA Molecules in the Fluorescence Microscope ¤ The present work describes the direct observation of structural changes and enzyme reactions at individual DNA molecules in a conventional fluorescence microscope. The marked DNA is coupled to a microsphere, which serves as a "grip" to hold the molecule with an optical tweezers and thus allows the selection of an individual DNA molecule. The stretching of a molecule and the observation of the subsequent relaxation enable the investigation of its structural dynamics. The analysis of enzymatic reactions occurs after microinjection of a restriction endonuclease into the environment of a stretched molecule and the distribution characterized by its microfluidity. It is described the sequence-independent binding of restriction endonucleases to DNA, followed by a linear diffusion of the enzyme along the DNA. Furthermore, a distinction of individually selected similar DNA is shown through its characteristic fragment pattern after restriction with a known endonuclease.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183788-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070512-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039972-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290958-2>
So will I flee from myself ¤ Italy was initially the land that united pleasure and education for Freud, later also a place where all longings and fears unfolded. Marina D’Angelo makes the fascinating way of Freud’s travel description the core of this first comprehensive study of his 25 Italian trips from 1895 to 1923. When Freud dreams of fleeing the worries of his Viennese homeland to Rome with a 'Punch with Lethe' or reports on the 'libido freed by the loss of Italy', we look impressively into his inner world on travels. D’Angelo reveals Freud's travel impressions and their context from a psychoanalytic and literary perspective. At the same time, she also shows, using previously unpublished Freud texts, how the trips affected the development of psychoanalysis: from the 17 'Italian' dreams of the Interpretation of Dreams to the discovery of the parapraxis, the importance of Rome and Pompeii as a plastic representation of the unconscious, the essays of applied psychoanalysis on Leonardo and Michelangelo's Moses to the experience of the 'Uncanny'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049275-8>

Water Protection in the Legislative Competence Framework of the European Multi-Level System ¤ This work was accepted as a dissertation by the Faculty Council of the Faculty of Law at Friedrich Schiller University Jena in the winter semester 2013/2014. The author addresses the question of what criteria should be used for a sensible distribution of competences. By the example of water protection, it is investigated whether the legislative competence order of the European multi-level system corresponds to the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, and subsidiarity. For this purpose, the concepts and terms of water protection, the multi-level system, and competence are explained in the first part of the work. Based on these concepts and terms, the national and European legislative competences in the field of water protection are analyzed and checked in the second part of the work to see if this competence order meets the requirements of water protection. In this context, the previous configurations of the competence regulations are also intensively examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048849-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020830-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071795-1>
Moving in the In-Between : A Phenomenological Approach to School Space Research ¤ The investigation inquires into the school space experiences of elementary school students. With a phenomenological understanding of space and architecture, the in-between is brought into focus, which is to determine between the world of things and the world of humans. In order to open up the pathic dimension, the exploratory method of narrative school tours was used in addition to the participating experience. In the mobile video-recorded explorations, the response phenomenon between students and school space is of importance, which is approached in the course of co-experience through language and movement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076536-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216380-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022350-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048561-4>
Why Climate Protection Anyway? : On the Justification of Climate Policy ¤ Statt die Notwendigkeit von Klimaschutz schlicht festzusetzen widmet sich das Buch zunächst umfassend der Begründung von Klimapolitik mit ethischen Argumenten. Nach einigen Vorüberlegungen werden aus der gängigen liberalen Begründungspraxis Kriterien einer überzeugenden Rechtfertigung gewonnen. Anhand dieser wird exemplarisch die utilitaristische Herangehensweise Bernward Gesangs mit dem diskursethisch fundierten Menschenrechtsansatz Felix Ekardts verglichen und sich schließlich für eine Lesart des Klimaschutzes als Menschenrechtsschutz ausgesprochen. Die zweite Hälfte des Buches behandelt dann ausführlich Abwägungen klimaethisch relevanter Prinzipien und Aspekte, wie sie etwa bei der Konkretisierung des Pariser Abkommens zu berücksichtigen wären. Neben den dabei zentralen Bereichen der intergenerationellen und der globalen Gerechtigkeit werden auch Fragen der Inklusion, der Individual- sowie der Tier- und Naturethik beleuchtet. Instead of simply stating the necessity to tackle climate change this book seeks for an ethic justification of a strong policy of mitigation and adaptation. After some preliminary considerations it gains criteria of a possibly successful justification from common practices of justification in liberal societies. An exemplary comparison of an utilitarian and a discourse ethics-based human-rights-approach leads to the claim that climate change should be addressed as a threat to fundamental human rights. The book´s second half then outlines and discusses important principles, aspects and views of the debate about climate ethics, which might be considered when further developing the Paris Agreement. Not only issues of intergenerational and global justice are covered but also those of inclusion and individual ethics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194901-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290733-0>
Thermochemical Production of Hydrogen from Biomass with Special Consideration of Raw Gas Reforming ¤ In this work, preferably efficient overall processes for the production of hydrogen based on the thermochemical gasification of biomass are identified. Therefore these processes, consisting of gasification and gas processing were modeled consistent and realistic in Aspen Plus. In addition to the gasification process, a special focus was placed on the reforming of hydrocarbons contained in the raw gas. Main criterion for evaluation is the overall process efficiency based on the used primary energy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>

Engineering and analysis of the enantioselectivity of esterases ¤ The focus of this thesis is the engineering and analysis of the enantioselectivity of esterases using 3-phenylbutyric acid (3-PBA) as model substrate. An ultra high throughput assay for identification of enantioselective esterases has been developed, based on the combination of in vivo selection and flow cytometry. The in vivo selection medium consists of a couple of pseudo-enantiomers of 3-PBA; one enantiomer is coupled to glycerol (GE), and hydrolysis of this substrate will enable cell survival. The other enantiomer is coupled to the toxin 2,3-dibromopropanol (BE), the hydrolysis of this substrate will cause cell death. Thus, cell survival is a function of the enantioselectivity of the enzyme expressed. The pseudo-enantiomeric substrates are structurally similar to allow selection for enantioselectivity instead of selection for enzyme substrate affinity. Next, esterase BS2 was chosen as negative control to establish the selection system since it hydrolyses both pseudo-enantiomers with low enantioselectivity (E~3 and 1, respectively). High enantioselective esterases towards 3-PBA: esterases PestE and CL1 (E > 100, both (R)-selective) were identified in a screening and used as positive controls. Further, the hyperthermophilic esterase PestE was crystallized. After elucidation of the enzyme structure, the high enantioselectivity of the enzyme towards 3-PBA could be explained by molecular modelling ...

Crystallisation of semiconductive oxides from borate glasses ¤ A preparation method was developed in order to obtain undoped and doped In2O3 and SnO2 nanopowders through controlled crystallisation of borate glasses and subsequent dissolution of the matrix in acetic acid. The nano-powders have been separated through dissolution of the additionally formed non In-containing crystalline phases and the glassy phase, and then subsequently dialysed. Glasses in the systems: Na2O/B2O3/Al2O3/In2O3 / (SnO2) and Na2O/B2O3/Al2O3/SnO2/ (Sb2O3) have been studied and nanopowders of In2O3, In2O3:SnO2, SnO2 and SnO2:Sb2O3 with crystalline sizes kleiner 50 nm have been prepared through controlled crystallisation in the temperature range from 500 to 80 ʿC. The SnO2 doping to the In2O3 as well as the heat treatment conditions have been studied in order to determine their influence on the optical properties of the In2O3 and In2O3:SnO2 nanoparticles. The desired combination of high transparency in VIS-and non-transparency in NIR-range of the In2O3 nanoparticles is achieved through doping of In2O3 (5 mol%) with 1 mol% SnO2 and heat treatment under reduction atmosphere (5% H2 and 95% Ar).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022993-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8>

Functional nanoporous carbon-based materials derived from oxocarbon-metal coordination complexes ¤ Nanoporous carbon based materials are of particular interest for both science and industry due to their exceptional properties such as a large surface area, high pore volume, high electroconductivity as well as high chemical and thermal stability. Benefiting from these advantageous properties, nanoporous carbons proved to be useful in various energy and environment related applications including energy storage and conversion, catalysis, gas sorption and separation technologies. The synthesis of nanoporous carbons classically involves thermal carbonization of the carbon precursors (e.g. phenolic resins, polyacrylonitrile, poly(vinyl alcohol) etc.) followed by an activation step and/or it makes use of classical hard or soft templates to obtain well-defined porous structures. However, these synthesis strategies are complicated and costly; and make use of hazardous chemicals, hindering their application for large-scale production.

Semi-stationary shoulder bobbin tool (S3BT): a new approach in high speed friction stir welding ¤ Next to the advantages, in Bobbin Tool Friction Stir Welding (BT-FSW) the excessive heat generated by both shoulders leads to an excessive degradation of the joint microstructure and a consequent loss in mechanical properties. During this work a new set of welding tools and a new unique experimental BT-FSW system was created. An analytical model was introduced, which identified the kinetic energy on the retreating side of the weld zone as a critical value in the modelling to indicate the experimental feasibility. The Semi-Stationary Bobbin Tool (S3BT) process variant has shown good results in reducing handling forces in combination with considerable high welding speeds of 3000 mm/min and low energy inputs. The adaption of the tool concept to articulated arm robots appears realistic. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7554620-6>

Process intensification of biological desulphurisation of biogas ¤ The double stage biological desulphurisation, consisting of a scrubber with downstream biological regeneration, was improved using humic substances as solubilisers. The optimisation of H2S removal by humic substances and the regeneration by sulphur bacteria of the washing liquid containing humic substances were analysed and evaluated. The experiments as well as the simulation of the scrubber showed that biogas can be desulphurised very efficiently by the addition of humic substances.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Casimir-Polder forces on atoms in the presence of magnetoelectric bodies ¤ The Casimir-Polder force on a single atom in the presence of microscopic magneto-electric bodies is studied within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In the first part, time-independent perturbation theory is used show that the static Casimir-Polder force on a ground-state atom in the presence of an arbitrary arrangement of bodies can be expressed in terms of the atom's polarisability and the scattering part of the Green tensor characterising the bodies. This result is used to verify the origin of the force and to study various bodies of simple shapes. In the second part, a genuinely dynamical approach is developed by starting from the operator Lorentz force. It is found that the dynamics of the force on initially excited atoms is governed by irreversible spontaneous decay in the case of weak atom-field coupling, while Rabi oscillations may arise for strong atom-field coupling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150208-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047982-1>
Mechanistic Investigations into the Nature of CH-Activated Cycloamination and Cyclohydroamination Reactions, Catalyzed by Transition and s-Block Metal Complexes ¤ A novel CN-cyclization, dealkylating CH-activated cycloamination (CDZA reaction) was investigated. Mechanistic studies were done by iterative changes of reaction conditions as well as on substrates and the catalyst. A new proposal of the catalytic cycle was achieved based on experimentally found data. Related Palladium complexes which show either κ1C- or k1N-coordinated triazenide ligands were synthesized and characterized. The synthesis of such complexes provides important evidence for the Hartwig-Buchwald amination derived CDZA reaction of triazenes and amidines. The reaction was found to be slow according to obtained TON and TOF numbers. Additionally, a variety of new NH- and N-methylated triazenes and amidines were provided. A deeper insight into the properties of both substrate classes was achieved (e.g., degradation focused on thermal degradation, pkA values and equilibrium of constitutional and configurational isomers) that allows accurate assessment of analytical data of the CDZA reaction. Since calcium and calciate complexes also catalyze amination reactions further objectives of this work were also the expansion to novel calcium amidinates which are functionalized with heteroatomic groups showing attractive additional coordination site for the A- and Ae-metal. Plenty of those complexes were synthesized and characterized within these studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162529-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186040-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195247-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0>
Structural Studies of Liquids and Glasses Using Aerodynamic Levitation ¤ This thesis presents neutron scattering data that contribute to the understanding of four distinct areas of condensed matter physics, including iso-compositional liquid-liquid phase transitions and the glass formation in rare earth doped BaTi2O5. In situ aerodynamic levitation with laser heating was combined with neutron scattering in order to study both liquid-liquid phase transitions in (Y2O3)x(Al2O3)1-x, and the atomic and magnetic ordering in liquid Invar. Among several significant results, obtained in this case from small angle neutron scattering, was the absence of a phase transition across a range of temperatures and compositions in the yttria aluminates. As these are a principal system in which liquid-liquid phase transitions have been hypothesized, this is an important contribution in a contentious area	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001590-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190443-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215431-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140379-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157463-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041980-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264210-3>
New geant4-based Monte Carlo software for the COMPASS-II experiment at CERN ¤ BEGIN Abstract: The substructure of the nucleon can be described within the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). According to Ji's sum-rule, the forward limit of the GPDs is directly linked to the total angular momenta of quarks and gluons. The exclusive measurement of deeply-virtual Compton scattering presents a promising experimental approach. The COMPASS-II experiment at CERN is designed to carry out these measurements. A profound understanding of the experimental acceptance and background estimates is key to measure absolute cross sections and can only be obtained with Monte Carlo.This thesis comprises the development of the new Geant4-based Monte Carlo Software TGEANT for the COMPASS-II experiment. TGEANT was optimized primarily for the GPD program, including a tuning of the electromagnetic shower simulation and a software model of the trigger system, but has since been extended to cover all other physics programs. It has become a standard in the COMPASS-II Monte Carlo chain and has been used by almost all recent analyses END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240945-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170957-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4360647-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4723679-6>
Analysis of Functionally Graded Porous Materials Using Deep Energy Method and Analytical Solution ¤ Porous materials are an emerging branch of engineering materials that are composed of two elements: One element is a solid (matrix), and the other element is either liquid or gas. Pores can be distributed within the solid matrix of porous materials with different shapes and sizes. In addition, porous materials are lightweight, and flexible, and have higher resistance to crack propagation and specific thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties. These properties are necessary for manufacturing engineering structures such as beams and other engineering structures. These materials are widely used in solid mechanics and are considered a good replacement for classical materials by many researchers recently. Producing lightweight materials has been developed because of the possibility of exploiting the properties of these materials. Various types of porous material are generated naturally or artificially for a specific application such as bones and foams. Like functionally graded materials, pore distribution patterns can be uniform or non-uniform. Biot’s theory is a well-developed theory to study the behavior of poroelastic materials which investigates the interaction between fluid and solid phases of a fluid-saturated porous medium. Functionally graded porous materials (FGPM) are widely used in modern industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and biomechanics. These advanced materials have some specific properties compared to materials with a classic structure. They are extremely light, while they have specific strength in mechanical and high-temperature environments. FGPMs are characterized by a gradual variation of material parameters over the volume. Although these materials can be made naturally, it is possible to design and manufacture them for a specific application. Therefore, many studies have been done to analyze the mechanical and thermal properties of FGPM structures, especially beams. Biot was the pioneer in formulating the linear elasticity and thermoelasticity equations of porous material. Since then, Biot's formulation has been developed in continuum mechanics which is named poroelasticity. There are obstacles to analyzing the behavior of these materials accurately like the shape of the pores, the distribution of pores in the material, and the behavior of the fluid (or gas) that saturated pores. Indeed, most of the engineering structures made of FGPM have nonlinear governing equations. Therefore, it is difficult to study engineering structures by solving these complicated equations. The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze porous materials in engineering structures. For this purpose, the complex equations of porous materials have been simplified and applied to engineering problems so that the effect of all parameters of porous materials on the behavior of engineering structure has been investigated. The effect of important parameters of porous materials on beam behavior including pores compressibility, porosity distribution, thermal expansion of fluid within pores, the interaction of stresses between pores and material matrix due to temperature increase, effects of pore size, material thickness, and saturated pores with fluid and unsaturated conditions are investigated. Two methods, the deep energy method, and the exact solution have been used to reduce the problem hypotheses, increase accuracy, increase processing speed, and apply these in engineering structures. In both methods, they are analyzed nonlinear and complex equations of porous materials. To increase the accuracy of analysis and study of the effect of shear forces, Timoshenko and Reddy's beam theories have been used. Also, neural networks such as residual and fully connected networks are designed to have high accuracy and less processing time than other computational methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313842-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046811-2>
Development of a holoscopic imaging system and applied high-resolution fluorescence microscopy ¤ Biomedical imaging helps extending our comprehension of ourselves and our environment. Advances in camera, laser and computation technologies have enabled an ever-increasing number of imaging technologies. Imaging with visible and infrared light has the advantage that it is less harmful than other radiation and its wavelength is in the order of magnitude of cells and subcellular components. Fluorescence microscopy provides good chemical contrast and multi-colour imaging can help elucidate cellular architecture. Incoherent superresolution methods permit us to bypass Abbe's diffraction limit of lateral resolution and visualize previously unnoticed details. Coherent imaging methods such as optical coherence tomography or holoscopy do not require any previous labelling and have the advantage that they record both the amplitude and phase of the light emitted from a scattering sample by interferometric superposition with a reference wave. Both incoherent an coherent imaging methods are used in this thesis. The results of two interdisciplinary research collaborations using different fluorescence microscopy methods, including superresolution methods, are presented. Podosomes in macrophages were studied with stimulated emission depletion microscopy, structured illumination microscopy and localisation microscopy and a distinctly polygonal shape in their vinculin rings was found. Image processing routines allowed for a quantitative analysis of the acquired images [1]. In the second study, chlorophyll, the most prominent natural pigments, and digested chlorophyll metabolites were detected in gut section of the herbivorous Spodoptera littoralis larva. Widefield and high-resolution autofluorescence microscopy revealed that the brush border membranes of their gut are covered with the chlorophyllide binding protein tightly bound to the gut membrane. A function in defense against gut microbes is discussed [2].	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193041-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147817-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290958-2>

Theoretical and Experimental Studies on Non-Fourier Heat Conduction Based on Thermomass Theory ¤ This book mainly focuses on the theoretical and experimental study of non-Fourier heat conduction behavior. A novel thermomass theory is used as the theoretical basis, which provides a general heat conduction equation for the accurate prediction of non-Fourier heat conduction. In order to prove the validity of this thermomass theory, a large current was used to heat the metallic nanofilm at the minimum temperature of 3 K. The measured average temperature of the nanofilm was notably higher than the prediction of Fourier’s heat diffusion equation, while matching well with the general heat conduction equation. This is the first time that steady non-Fourier heat conduction has been observed. Moreover, this book concerns the role of electron-phonon interaction in metallic nanofilms, which involves the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at low temperatures and interfacial thermal resistance at femtosecond timescales. Readers will find useful information on non-Fourier heat conduction and the latest advances in the study of charge and heat transport in metallic nanofilms	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311267-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252858-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232597-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136925-7>
Investigations on mobility of carbon colloid supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) for groundwater remediation ¤ The injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an innovative technology for in situ installation of a permeable reactive barrier in the subsurface. Zerovalent iron (ZVI) is highly reactive with chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and renders them into less harmful substances. Application of nZVI instead of granular ZVI can increase rates of dechlorination of CHCs by orders of magnitude, due to its higher surface area. This approach is still difficult to apply due to fast agglomeration and sedimentation of colloidal suspensions of nZVI, which leads to very short transport distances. To overcome this issue of limited mobility, polyanionic stabilisers are added to increase surface charge and stability of suspensions. In field experiments maximum transport distances of a few metres were achieved. A new approach, which is investigated in this thesis, is enhanced mobility of nZVI by a more mobile carrier colloid. The investigated composite material consists of activated carbon, which is loaded with nZVI. In this cumulative thesis, transport characteristics of carbon-colloid supported nZVI (c-nZVI) are investigated. Investigations started with column experiments in 40 cm columns filled with various porous media to investigate on physicochemical influences on transport characteristics. The experimental setup was enlarged to a transport experiment in a 1.2-m-sized two-dimensional aquifer tank experiment, which was filled with granular porous media. Further, a field experiment was performed in a natural aquifer system with a targeted transport distance of 5.3 m. Parallel to these investigations, alternative methods for transport observations were investigated by using noninvasive tomographic methods. Experiments using synchrotron radiation and magnetic resonance (MRI) were performed to investigate in situ transport characteristics in a non-destructive way. Results from column experiments show potentially high mobility under environmental relevant conditions. Addition of mono-and bivalent salts, e.g. more than 0.5 mM/L CaCl2, might decrease mobility. Changes in pH to values below 6 can inhibit mobility at all. Measurements of colloid size show changes in the mean particle size by a factor of ten. Measurements of zeta potential revealed an increase of –62 mV to –82 mV. Results from the 2D-aquifer test system suggest strong particle deposition in the first centimetres and only weak straining in the further travel path and no gravitational influence on particle transport. Straining at the beginning of the travel path in the porous medium was observed with tomographic investigations of transport. MRI experiments revealed similar results to the previous experiments, and observations using synchrotron radiation suggest straining of colloids at pore throats. The potential for high transport distances, which was suggested from laboratory experiments, was confirmed in the field experiment, where the transport distance of 5.3 m was reached by at least 10% of injected nZVI. Altogether, transport distances of the investigated carbon-colloid supported nZVI are higher than published results of traditional nZVI	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135804-1>
Propagation of partially coherent light in optical systems ¤ There are in general three approaches to propagate partially coherent light. They include solving the Helmholtz equations for the correlation function, employing the Wigner function to propagate light in phase space, or using modal expansion. In this work, we investigate the interaction of partially spatially coherent light with optical systems. Our modeling methods are based on the Wigner function and modal expansion. First, we utilize the thin element approximation in the Wigner function to propagate partially coherent light through discontinuous surfaces. Our examples include the phase step, grating, kinoform lens, axicon and lens array. Phase space provides a vivid picture for understanding the diffraction effects, e.g. the diffracted orders formed by a grating, the multiple foci of a kinoform lens, and the beam homogenizing effect of a lens array, etc. This approach facilitates the design of diffractive elements and the interpretation of optical effects. Second, we improve the propagation algorithms for the Wigner function. These implementations include removing a parabolic wavefront of a beam, and an efficient propagator based on rotating the phase space. Both algorithms increase the computational speed without losing any physical accuracy. To overcome certain limitations of our phase space propagators, we investigate the modal expansion method. We use Schell beams as examples, to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eigenmode and shifted-elementary mode expansions. Afterward, we develop an expansion tool to efficiently propagate partially coherent light inside waveguides. This tool allows quick access to the light fields at any distance inside the waveguide. We thus obtain an accurate modeling of the diffraction effects produced by the waveguide structure. Our modeling methods pave the path to the experimental measurement of coherence. We discuss two schemes to retrieve the spatial coherence of a beam under test. The first scheme is to solve an inverse problem of the modal expansion. It requires iterative phase retrieval algorithms to recover the complex fields of individual modes. We extend this method to a beam with an arbitrary wavefront and discuss the potential and limits of this technique. The second scheme for coherence retrieval is to solve the inverse problem of the Wigner function, also known as the phase space tomography. To reconstruct a Wigner function requires an inverse Radon transform in a four-dimensional space. We present an overview of the two relevant algorithms, i.e. the filtered back projection and the ambiguity function reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an improved algorithm for the filtered back projection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158821-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159528-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267405-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519405-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258960-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195918-8>
Theoretical studies of the constriction of rare-gas glow discharge plasmas ¤ Gas discharge, rare gas, contraction, fluid modeling, positive column, low-temperature plasma, glow-to-arc transition, low-temperature plasma In the present work, a time- and radial-dependent fluid model has been developed to describe the glow-to-arc transition of the positive column in the course of constriction. The self-consistent model comprises the particle balance equations for the relevant species, the balance equation of the mean electron energy and the heavy particle temperature in the plasma, the Poisson equation for the space-charge potential, and a current balance determining the axial electric field. The model adopts the nonlocal moment method, i.e., the system of the balance equations resulting from the moments of the radially dependent Boltzmann equation is solved. The electron transport and rate coefficients are adapted as functions of the mean energy of the electrons, the gas temperature and the ionization degree. The model is applied to a description of the constriction of the dc positive column in argon, for a wide range of pressures and applied currents. Pronounced nonlocal features of the mean electron energy balance are found and their influence on the constricted argon positive column is analyzed...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4339344-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139645-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151020-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192606-7>
Respiration of sandy Baltic Sea sediments ¤ Changes in oxygen uptake due to advective as opposed to diffusive processes were investigated as a function of permeability. Investigations took place in the laboratory and in a study area in the Baltic Sea. Sandy sediments in this area are less influenced by advection than originally thought, but the oxygen uptake can be increased. In order to be able to differentiate oxygen uptake rates, a formula for a common bivalve species (Mya arenaria) was developed. Based on this, respiration rates for this species can now be calculated in relation to the respective length of the individuals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134766-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179222-1>
Multi-Scale Modeling of Mechanical and Electrochemical Properties of 1D and 2D Nanomaterials, Application in Battery Energy Storage Systems ¤ Material properties play a critical role in durable products manufacturing. Estimation of the precise characteristics in different scales requires complex and expensive experimental measurements. Potentially, computational methods can provide a platform to determine the fundamental properties before the final experiment. Multi-scale computational modeling leads to the modeling of the various time, and length scales include nano, micro, meso, and macro scales. These scales can be modeled separately or in correlation with coarser scales. Depend on the interested scales modeling, the right selection of multi-scale methods leads to reliable results and affordable computational cost. The present dissertation deals with the problems in various length and time scales using computational methods include density functional theory (DFT), molecular mechanics (MM), molecular dynamics (MD), and finite element (FE) methods. Physical and chemical interactions in lower scales determine the coarser scale properties. Particles interaction modeling and exploring fundamental properties are significant challenges of computational science. Downscale modelings need more computational effort due to a large number of interacted atoms/particles. To deal with this problem and bring up a fine-scale (nano) as a coarse-scale (macro) problem, we extended an atomic-continuum framework. The discrete atomic models solve as a continuum problem using the computationally efficient FE method. MM or force field method based on a set of assumptions approximates a solution on the atomic scale. In this method, atoms and bonds model as a harmonic oscillator with a system of mass and springs. The negative gradient of the potential energy equal to the forces on each atom. In this way, each bond's total potential energy includes bonded, and non-bonded energies are simulated as equivalent structural strain energies. Finally, the chemical nature of the atomic bond is modeled as a piezoelectric beam element that solves by the FE method. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217961-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004687-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4344251-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014247-4>
Interpretation of CFC Data in the Weddell Sea ¤ Regional oceanography, Antarctica, CFC, CFC, water masses, thermohaline circulation, AABW. - The aim of this thesis is to generate a circulation scheme of the deep water masses of the Weddell Sea with the primary objective to estimate production rates of different sources of these water masses using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data. Repeated observations of CFC for a section along the Prime Meridian from Antarctica (70ʿS) to approximately 50ʿS are presented for the period 1984 - 1998. In addition CFC data from the Weddell Sea section (Kapp Norvegia - Joinville Island) are considered.

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based detection schemes for food analytics ¤ The development of the food industry over the last century has broadened the range of available food products and increased the awareness of society regarding the importance of a healthy diet. As a direct consequence of this, norms and regulation regarding the composition of different products were formulated and are enforced. Still, different food products have a very short shelf-life (i.e. fruits and vegetable) and accordingly, their analysis should be performed in a time and price effective way, while maintaining a high standard for the quality and reliability of the analysis. The current gold standard analytical technique for most of the food products is high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with different detection schemes such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. There are, however, analytes where HPLC-based measurements encounter difficulties and research is still needed in order to overcome these. For those molecules, analysis based on biological assays are applied as reference analytical method. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172264-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034911-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151897-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138551-2>
Modeling and Simulation of a Thermochemical Refrigerator on Metal Hydride Basis ¤ A study on the heat and mass transfer in coupled metal hydride reaction beds is of particular interest in the design and optimization of thermochemical refrigerator on the basis of metal hydrides. The present work examines a comprehensive two-dimensional dynamic heat and mass transfer in coupled metal hydride reaction beds. It is focused on the solution of the governing equations for the transient heat and mass transfer with consideration of the simultaneous absorption and desorption, kinetic rate equation and boundary conditions for coupling. The non linear coupled differential equations of the governing equations are solved numerically by the finite element method with COMSOL Multiphysics®. In order to verify and validate the simulation model coupled reaction beds filled with Ti27,2Zr5,8Mn47V17Fe3 and Ti30,5Zr2,5Mn47,3V15Fe2,7 alloys are experimentally investigated. The results of the numerical simulations show good agreement with the experimental results. For the design and optimization of thermochemical refrigerators on metal hydride basis, knowledge of heat and mass transfer in coupled metal hydride reactors is of crucial importance. This work includes a detailed two-dimensional modeling and simulation of coupled metal hydride reactors with particular emphasis on their use in a metal hydride refrigerator. In a theoretical model, a partial differential equation system for heat and mass transfer in coupled reactors is used, including absorption and desorption, kinetic equation, and reactor coupling conditions. For the solution of the partial differential equation system, the simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics®, based on the finite element method (FEM), is used. In addition, own experiments on coupled reactors in laboratory scale are carried out on the basis of low-temperature hydrides Ti27,2Zr5,8Mn47V17Fe3 and Ti30,5Zr2,5Mn47,3V15Fe2,7. A good agreement between simulated and experimental results is demonstrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078260-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064784-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121905-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133762-1>

Development of Spinel Thin-Film Cathodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries and their Characterization by Lock-In Thermography ¤ In this work lock-in thermography (LIT) is used as an in-situ method for the characterization of cathodes (wet-chemically prepared LiMn2O4 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinels) and graphite composite anodes in pouch cells. In combination with scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy it was possible to obtain informations on aging as well as inhomogeneities of the examined electrodes. Electrochemical characterization of the cathodes preceded the investigation by LIT. This included cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cycling at different charging / discharging currents. With the help of an adapted cell design and suitably chosen parameters, it was possible to identify inhomogeneities in the cell composition of the graphite composite anodes. In the aged state, these also show a typical ring pattern, which is attributed to an inhomogeneous contact pressure in the cell.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167934-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059835-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142547-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7681721-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158067-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163451-2>

Energy band gap tuning of halide perovskite materials from first principles ¤ Solar cells based on hybrid perovskites materials have become significantly important among the third generation photovoltaics over the last few years. The first solid state solar cell was reported in 2012. Over the years, the power conversion efficiencies of these devices have increased at a tremendous pace and this has made the perovskite solar cell devices a serious competitor in the well-established market of thin-film and wafer technologies. Over time, a large number of articles on this topic has been published in peer-reviewed journals. The presence of lead in the most efficient hybrid perovskite materials have raised questions about the possible toxicity of these devices and the extent of their environmental impact. Therefore, a lot of research has been devoted to finding alternative perovskite materials with similar or even better opto-electronic properties. An alternative strategy to improve the efficiency of thin film solar cells is to build efficient tandem cells by combining two or more perovskite materials with specifically tailored band gaps.

Green Technologies in Markets with Network Effects: State Intervention in the Automotive Sector ¤ Green technologies in the automobile sector are discussed as a mean to fight climate change. In order to stimulate the sale of electric vehicles, many governments already authorized bonuses for buyers or took comparable measures. The German government is still reluctant. Against this background, this volume investigates if Germany should take similar political measures and considers the construction of a new service infrastructure of charging stations that would be required by electric vehicles.As a result, the economic analysis shows that network effects hinder the market entry of new drivetrain technologies and thus provide an argument for political actions. Meanwhile, green technologies need to prove an actual positive climate effect. Otherwise, possible high investments in new infrastructures are not justified from an economical point of view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1042006857> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246990-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1>

Describing and predicting molecular properties via vibrational spectroscopy in combination with electron density analysis ¤ The major aim of the present work is the correlation of electron density investigations with vibrational spectroscopic studies. In particular, Raman spectroscopy was applied to qualitatively approve DFT-calculated changes in the electron density distribution induced by structural modic̄ations. Moreover, a method was derived to predict properties of the electron density distribution quantitatively via combinations of vibrational spectroscopic and NMR spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the initial changes in the electron density distribution upon photoexcitation and related changes in the molecular structure were investigated via resonance Raman spectroscopy. The results of all these studies are shortly summarized in the following.

Osmotic pressure effects on collagen mimetic peptides ¤ Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals. In many tissues, collagen molecules assemble to form a hierarchical structure. In the smallest supramolecular unit, named fibril, each molecule is displaced in the axial direction with respect to its neighbors. This staggering creates a periodic gap and overlap regions, where the gap regions exhibit 20% less density. These fibril-forming collagens play an essential role in the strength of connective tissues. Despite much effort, directed at understanding collagen function and regulation, the influence of the chemical environment on the local structural and mechanical properties remains poorly understood. Recent studies, aimed at elucidating the effect of osmotic pressure, showed that collagen contracts upon water removal. This observation highlights the importance of water for the stabilization and mechanics of the collagen molecule. Using collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs), which fold into triple helical structures reminiscent of natural collagen, the primary goal of this work was to investigate the effect of the osmotic pressure on specific collagen-mimetic sequences. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164652-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172912-2>
Colloid mobility controlling processes in single fractures : a bottom-up approach ¤ Rock fractures can serve as water conducting structures for fluid flow and mass transport within the Earth’s crust. Large apertures, which enable high flow velocities, and a rock matrix with several orders of magnitude lower permeability, are accountable that those structures serve as preferential conduits for solutes and colloids. The mechanistic understanding of fundamental transport and retention processes is essential to make reliable predictions of the fate of solutes and colloids in the subsurface. This comprehensive topic is of paramount importance in many areas of geo-engineering, for example disposal of nuclear waste in deep geological formations, enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 sequestration, gas and oil industry, and contaminant transport in groundwater systems. This cumulative Ph.D. thesis deals with the investigation of the impact of flow channel geometry on solute and colloid transport through natural rough fractures. The bottom-up approach used in this thesis helped to investigate separately the mechanisms and the processes on mass transport (solute and colloids) in four steps. All experiments in this thesis were conducted under hydraulic and chemical settings establishing laminar flow and overall unfavorable colloid attachment conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480861-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057696-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198409-2>
Trends in precipitation over Germany and the Rhine basin related to changes in weather patterns ¤ Precipitation as the central meteorological feature for agriculture, water security, and human well-being amongst others, has gained special attention ever since. Lack of precipitation may have devastating effects such as crop failure and water scarcity. Abundance of precipitation, on the other hand, may as well result in hazardous events such as flooding and again crop failure. Thus, great effort has been spent on tracking changes in precipitation and relating them to underlying processes. Particularly in the face of global warming and given the link between temperature and atmospheric water holding capacity, research is needed to understand the effect of climate change on precipitation. The present work aims at understanding past changes in precipitation and other meteorological variables. Trends were detected for various time periods and related to associated changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation. The results derived in this thesis may be used as the foundation for attributing changes in floods to climate change.…	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042236-7>
Organic molecular nanotechnology ¤ The p-hexaphenylene (p6P) has proven to be a versatile building block for generating long, parallely aligned organic nanofibers exhibiting outstanding (optical) properties by a self-assembly process on a muscovite mica substrate. Functional groups were implemented at the 1,4-́́́para-positions of p-quaterphenylenes (p4P) using a non-trivial Suzuki cross-coupling strategy for tailormade nanofibers. The fluorescence peak emission frequency shifts within the blue and the overall shape alters depending on the functionalisation. Due to intrinsic non-zero hyperpolarisability of push-pull functionalised oligomers and non-centrosymmetry of the respective nanofibers, they act as frequency doublers.

Tectonically-controlled emplacement mechanisms in the upper crust under specific stress regimes : case studies ¤ With regards to emplacement controlled by tectonic activity, sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous materials share many similarities. This is not only because that most of the features are associated with pre-existing structures (e.g. joints, bedding planes, faults), but also the physical occurrence of intrusions in the upper crust, regardless of which material (i.e. salt, shale, clastic deposits, magma), show similar shapes, distribution and emplacement mechanisms, which are mainly controlled by regional tectonics. Four field studies deal with the conditions of opening of tectonic fractures in the upper crust, their propagation, interaction and final emplacement. The following examples aim to better understand (1) the influence of pre-existing tectonic features on emplacement mechanisms in the upper crust; (2) tectonic effect on magma movement and location of eruption sites; (3) the feedback between faulting and magmatism; and (4) conditions and mechanisms of dyke emplacement ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054079-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064081-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296254-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354981-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027528-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174929-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131258-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247365-2>
Sample supervised search centric approaches in geographic object-based image analysis ¤ Sample supervised search centric image segmentation denotes a general method where quality segments are generated based on the provision of a selection of reference segments. The main purpose of such a method is to correctly segment a multitude of identical elements in an image based on these reference segments. An efficient search algorithm traverses the parameter space of a given segmentation algorithm. A supervised quality measure guides the search for the best segmentation results, or rather the best performing parameter set. This method, which is academically pursued in the context of remote sensing and elsewhere, shows promise in assisting the generation of earth observation information products. The method may find applications specifically within the context of user driven geographic object-based image analysis approaches, mainly in respect of very high resolution optical data. Rapid mapping activities as well as general land-cover mapping or targeted element identification may benefit from such a method. In this work it is suggested that sample supervised search centric geographic segment generation forms the basis of a set of methods, or rather a methodological avenue. The original formulation of the method, although promising, is limited in the quality of the segments it can produce – it is still limited by the inherent capability of the given segmentation algorithm. From an optimisation viewpoint, various structures may be encoded forming the fitness or search landscape traversed by a given search algorithm. These structures may interact or have an interplay with the given segmentation algorithm. Various method variants considering expanded fitness landscapes are possible. Additional processes, or constituents, such as data mapping, classification and post-segmentation heuristics may be embedded into such a method. Three distinct and novel method variants are proposed and evaluated based on this concept of expanded fitness landscapes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224344-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116326-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145448-0>
Independence Regimes in the European Administrative Federation: A European and Constitutional Law Investigation of Union Law Organizational Regulations for Member States Based on Regulatory Agencies, Data Protection Authorities, and Statistical Offices ¤ Due to EU law, national authorities must act ‘independently’ and as if they are integrated into administrative networks. By means of three reference areas (telecommunications, data protection and official statistics), this study shows that this is a general development in EU administrative law.Bearing in mind the EU’s multilevel system, the study elucidates the requirements of EU and German constitutional law. Within this framework, it becomes apparent that the EU’s legal acts neither violate the national identity nor the institutional autonomy of its Member States. In addition, the principles of democracy and rule of law at the heart of Germany’s basic constitutional law can be upheld. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to implementing the EU’s legal acts into German law.Overall, the study portrays an up-to-date and comprehensive picture of the institutional law of independent national authorities in terms of EU administrative law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063317-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198017-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801271-3>

In this thesis we will use the unified approach of Mrázek et al. to study some asymptotic properties of local smoothers with regularization. In particular, we shall discuss the Huber M-estimate and its limiting cases towards the L2 and the L1 cases. For the regularization part, we will use quadratic regularization. Then, we will define a more general class of regularization functions. Finally, we will do a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare different types of estimates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4774972-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4846428-4>

Incorporation of heteroaryl-substituted educts into intermolecular titanium-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with secondary amines for the generation of new structural motifs ¤ BEGIN: In this work novel dimethyl titanium complexes were prepared and fully characterized, starting from indenylethylamines. Depending on the substituent on the nitrogen atom of indenylethylamine, the complexes showed different catalytic activities in various inter- and intramolecular hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation reactions. In addition, α-thienyl amines were reacted with styrene to give the linear intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation products. 2-Allylfuran and 2-allylthiophene and furyl, thienyl and benzothienyl substituted allyl and vinyl silanes were also reacted with N-methylanilines in an intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reaction. An additional bromo substituent on the heteroaromatic system was tolerated, too. The hydroaminoalkylation products resulting from the bromo substituted alkenes were reacted in a Buchwald-Hartwig-amination. In this way, it was possible to produce literature-unknown fused ring systems in a one-pot procedure.

Complexity in Financial Markets : Modeling Psychological Behavior in Agent-Based Models and Order Book Models ¤ Tools and methods from complex systems science can have a considerable impact on the way in which the quantitative assessment of economic and financial issues is approached, as discussed in this thesis. First it is shown that the self-organization of financial markets is a crucial factor in the understanding of their dynamics. In fact, using an agent-based approach, it is argued that financial markets’ stylized facts appear only in the self-organized state. Secondly, the thesis points out the potential of so-called big data science for financial market modeling, investigating how web-driven data can yield a picture of market activities: it has been found that web query volumes anticipate trade volumes. As a third achievement, the metrics developed here for country competitiveness and product complexity is groundbreaking in comparison to mainstream theories of economic growth and technological development. A key element in assessing the intangible variables determining the success of countries in the present globalized economy is represented by the diversification of the productive basket of countries.

Foundations : how the built environment made twentieth-century Britain ¤ The Industrial Estate -- The Shopping Precinct -- The Council Estate -- The Private Housing Estate -- The Shopping Mall -- The Business Park -- Conclusion: The Burden of Obsolescence. "This book is a history of the British built environment from the late nineteenth century to the present. Unlike other urban histories of Britain, the book shows how the city helped produce rather than merely reflect the major intellectual and ideological currents that transformed its recent history. Each chapter of the book tells the story of a different type of urban space in Britain. The first part of the book traces the emergence of the industrial trading estate, the shopping center and the council estate. The second part shows how these three forms mutated into the private block of flats, the out-of-town shopping mall and the suburban office park. The story of these six forms touches on histories of criminology, histories of energy and heating, histories of consumerism and the history of housework and takes the reader to almost every major British city as well as to the United States, Singapore and the Britain's Empire in West Africa.

Utilization of graphitic carbon nitride in dispersed media ¤ The utilization of sunlight for energy harvesting has been foreseen as sustainable replacement for fossil fuels, which would also eliminate side effects arising from fossil fuel consumption such as drastic increase of CO2 in Earth atmosphere. Semiconductor materials can be implemented for energy harvesting, and design of ideal energy harvesting devices relies on effective semiconductor with low recombination rate, ease of processing, stability over long period, non-toxicity and synthesis from abundant sources. Aforementioned criteria have attracted broad interest for graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) materials, metal-free semiconductor which can be synthesized from low cost and abundant precursors. Furthermore, physical properties such as band gap, surface area and absorption can be tuned. g-CN was investigated as heterogeneous catalyst, with diversified applications from water splitting to CO2 reduction and organic coupling reactions. However, low dispersibility of g-CN in water and organic solvents was an obstacle for future improvements. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158817-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327236-8>
Investigations on the Signal Transduction of the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) ¤ cell adhesion molecules; immunoglobulin superfamily; axon; phosphorylation; signal transduction pathway; CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein); FAK (focal adhesion kinase); ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases); FGF-R (Fibroblast Growth Factor); endocytosis The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is a membrane-associated glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is highly expressed on the cell surface of neuronal cells. It is implicated in various functions during development and maintenance of the nervous system. Homophilic NCAM binding mediates cell adhesion and leads to the activation of a complex network of intracellular signaling cascades. NCAM possesses an extracellular domain, which consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains and two fibronectin-type-III-domains. Apart from that NCAM also has a large intracellular domain, which plays an important role in signal transduction and during NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. This cytoplasmic domain of NCAM contains, depending on the isoform, up to 49 potential phosphorylation sites. Although it is known that during the NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth the phosphorylation of the intracellular domain increases, it is not yet known which phosphorylation sites are involved. We have indentified that serine 774 of NCAM140 is necessary for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth and activation of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein). Furthermore we could show, that serine 774 is involved in signal transduction and endocytosis of NCAM.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318717-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300852-5>
Efficient non-spatial and spatial simulation of biochemical reaction networks ¤ The dissertation is focused on algorithms for performing non-spatial and spatial stochastic simulations of reaction networks and on the exploration of improved or alternative approaches. Central topics are the evaluation and a subsequent comparison of algorithm performance in terms of execution speed and accuracy, the extension of temporal leap methods to the spatial realm as well as the introduction of a variant for a parallel execution, and the realization of a multi-algorithm simulation which introduces inter-rules to forge a link between the synchronized execution of subsidiary algorithms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145593-9>
Political Consumers in the Social Web: Practices of Mediation between Civic and Consumer Identity ¤ An examination of the everyday political engagement of women and their contribution to a net-based 'civic culture'. Political participation is changing. The social science discourse repeatedly points to a shift of citizens towards new forms of engagement that lie outside the channels of influence of the representative system. In this process, the Social Web has a special significance, as it potentially represents a space for civic education processes. Katharina Witterhold examines the underlying conditions of this development using the example of political consumers. With a view to women as pioneers of a new style of politics, as well as the development of a praxeological analytical perspective on everyday politics, her study also enters new theoretical terrain.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076215-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548364-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062644-1>
Detection and Characterization of Polyphosphate-Storing Bacteria in Aquatic Sediments ¤ This thesis investigated the occurrence of polyphosphate (poly-P) in different lake sediments in combination with a molecular characterization of the bacterial communitiy structure on different phylogenetic levels applying 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, DGGE and CARD-FISH. The inducibility of poly-P synthesis in the uppermost sediment layers and stimulation of growth of Poly-P accumulating bacteria (PAO) were studied in laboratory experiments. A high bacterial diversity was found in all studied samples but no significant correlations occurred between poly-P contents and the presence of specific microbial groups. Since analysis of microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and FISH did not reveal PAO in the poly-P rich lake sediments a laser microdissection method has been established for the separation of poly-P positive bacterial cells (visualized by DAPI staining under a fluorescence microscope) from lake sediment and activated sludge samples. Coupled with a phylogenetic characterization of the selected bacteria a high diversity of known and unknown PAO were identified across all samples. <engl.> Das Vorkommen von Polyphosphat (Poly-P) in den obersten Sedimentschichten verschiedener Gewässer wurde untersucht. Parallel erfolgte eine molekularbiologische Charakterisierung der Bakteriengemeinschaften auf unterschiedlichem phylogenetischem Niveau durch 16S rDNA Klonbibliotheken, DGGE und CARD-FISH. Ergänzende Untersuchungen wurden mittels Inkubationsexperimenten durchgeführt. Es zeigte sich in allen Proben eine große Diversität, in keinem Fall koinzidierte jedoch ein gehäuftes Vorkommen einer bestimmten Großgruppe mit einem hohen Poly-P Gehalt. Da die bisher eingesetzten Methoden zur Charakterisierung der Bakteriengemeinschaft in Hinblick auf Poly-P speichernden Bakterien (PAO) nicht den erhofften Erfolg brachten, wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Laser-Mikrodissektion für Umweltproben etabliert. Bakterien mit Poly-P Granula wurden gezielt aus Sediment- und Belebtschlammproben separiert und phylogenetisch charakterisiert. Erste Ergebnisse zeigen eine hohe Diversität von bekannten aber auch bisher unbekannten Poly-P speichernden Bakterien in den untersuchten Proben. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175289-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129652-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0>
Cryptochrome photoreceptors in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: versatility of functions and mechanisms ¤ Photosynthetic microorganisms, including microalgae and cyanobacteria, account to half of global CO2 fixation. Light governs their photosynthesis and other biological functions. Specifically, cryptochromes, photoreceptors found universally, primarily detect UV-A/blue light and are known to repair DNA. This study focuses on five algal cryptochromes, especially CRY-DASH1 (Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Synechocystis, Homo) in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Located in the chloroplast, CRY-DASH1's expression peaks around midday. A mutant lacking CRY-DASH1 showed decreased growth but enhanced photosynthesis efficiency. Furthermore, the mutant revealed increased pigment amounts, hyper-stacking of the thylakoid membrane and elevated levels of photosystem II proteins like D1 and CP43, but not of their transcripts. These data suggest that CRY-DASH1 plays its role as regulator at the posttranscriptional/translational level. CRY-DASH1 has an absorption peak in the UV-A range and supplementation of white light with UV-A increases photoautotrophic growth of wild type but not of the mutant lacking CRY-DASH1. Comparative analysis of the chloroplast proteome of wild type and of the mutant revealed that multiple proteins, including key enzymes for the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids, as well as acyl-lipid metabolism and photoprotection, are upregulated in the mutant. In contrast, we found that essential proteins from the central carbon metabolism, are downregulated. Additionally, we discovered that the mutant revealed a downregulation of certain enzymes involved in histidine metabolism which leads to a reduction in the quantity of free histidine. Another cryptochrome, CRY-DASH2, when mutated, exhibited similar growth reduction and pigment increase. The study ends pondering if CRY-DASH1 and CRY-DASH2 might have overlapping functionalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147746-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045934-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4453251-9>
Contract Conclusion in the Internet of Things: Consumer Protection in the Use of Networked Systems ¤ BEGIN The Internet of Things has the potential to permanently change everyday consumer life. Consumers can conclude contracts via connected devices or have them concluded by artificially intelligent systems. Christine Biggen examines the application of consumer protection law in this context. The Internet of Things has the potential to not only change industrial processes but also to sustainably change private everyday life. When a consumer concludes a contract via a connected object, this raises dogmatic questions in the area of contract conclusion as well as the question of the applicability of §§ 312 ff. BGB. Christine Biggen investigates these problem fields and takes a focus on the consumer protection law rights and obligations framework. Above all, when implementing the predominantly developed information and design obligations for contract conclusions on websites, a need for adaptation becomes apparent. Finally, system-immanent solution concepts de lege ferenda are presented, which maintain the current level of consumer protection but also take into account technological development and the use of artificial intelligence.

Probing the pathways of free charge generation and recombination in organic solar cells : the role of excess energy and dispersive effects ¤ Organic semiconductors are a promising class of materials. Their special properties are the particularly good absorption, low weight and easy processing into thin films. Therefore, intense research has been devoted to the realization of thin film organic solar cells (OPVs). Because of the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors, primary excitations (excitons) are strongly bound and a type II heterojunction needs to be introduced to split these excitations into free charges. Therefore, most organic solar cells consist of at least an electron donor and electron acceptor material. For such donor acceptor systems mainly three states are relevant; the photoexcited exciton on the donor or acceptor material, the charge transfer state at the donor-acceptor interface and the charge separated state of a free electron and hole. The interplay between these states significantly determines the efficiency of organic solar cells. Due to the high absorption and the low charge carrier mobilities, the active layers are usually thin but also, …	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035711-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141129-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131115-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4774524-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7617672-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307016-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/116732739X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049338-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043816-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263396-5>
Studies towards radical and metalhydride mediated carbonylation reactions ¤ In this dissertation, we present a new method for the Mn-catalyzed ring-opening carbonylation of cyclobutanols.

We then report the first Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation in which the oxidant could be completely replaced by visible light. Oxalamides were obtained from the corresponding amines.

Burkholderia as bacterial symbionts of Lagriinae beetles : symbiont transmission, prevalence and ecological significance in Lagria villosa and Lagria hirta (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)  ¤ Symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature and can play a crucial role in shaping the biology of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Importantly, the interaction of microorganisms with eukaryotes can range from pathogenicity to mutualism, also shifting along this continuum. The ecological settings facilitating such lifestyle transitions are, however, poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on the symbiosis between Lagriinae beetles and Burkholderia gladioli, a bacterium mostly known for its plant pathogenic traits. In Lagria hirta and Lagria villosa beetles, I localized these bacteria on adults, larvae and eggs of both species confirming a vertical transmission route. The presence of B. gladioli in these and four other Lagriinae species suggested that the association is relatively ancient and evolved within this phytopathogenic bacterial group. Additionally, B. gladioli from L. villosa can successfully infect soybean plants, a food source for this beetle species, and negatively affect the plant’s reproductive output, implying that the insect symbiont conserves the ability to intimately interact with a plant. Presumably, the potential of plant pathogenic B. gladioli bacteria to produce potent bioactive substances was also essential for establishing a mutualism with the insect. In L. villosa beetles, I could show that B. gladioli on the surface of eggs inhibit the growth of antagonistic fungi. I thereby demonstrate a symbiont-mediated defense, which could be highly advantageous at the nutrient-rich and immobile egg stage. Furthermore, we elucidated four compounds (toxoflavin, caryoynencin, lagriene and lagriamide) that could be responsible for the protective effect by the symbionts. Finally, multiple symbiotic B. gladioli strains were found coexisting in individual beetles, bringing about interesting questions regarding the potential advantages of strain diversity in defensive symbiosis and the evolutionary dynamics supporting their long-term maintenance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4556223-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027110-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136029-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130263-1>
Robust monocular camera-based localization under challenging perceptual conditions ¤ BEGIN<br>Abstract: Visual localization of autonomous vehicles is imperative to their safe navigation in particular scenarios. The paradigm of monocular camera localization encompasses broad range of applications like place recognition, loop closure detections within a SLAM framework, 6-DoF metric camera pose estimation and augmented reality. To achieve accurate and reliable pose estimates, camera-based localization approaches need to cope with wide variety of challenging perceptual conditions. These methods should be robust to variation in illumination due to day-night changes, different weather conditions and seasonal variations. An autonomous robot should be able to cope with all such variations that enables it to operate over long periods of time.<br>In this thesis, we primarily focus on novel robust methods for long term camera-based visual localization that cope with wide variety of viewing conditions. We highlight the shortcomings of state-of-the-art feature-based methods for monocular cameras and present novel approaches to achieve reliable localization. Although, cameras provide an cost effective solution for autonomous navigation, image data is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions. The rich texture and color information in the images vary drastically over long periods of time. In this work, we develop distinctive and repeatable feature descriptions of images that allow robots to localize under a great spectrum of perceptual conditions. We also develop novel methods that leverage semantics of the environment to imitate human-like behavior in autonomous systems during localization. These methods also scale well with the large map sizes. <br>At first, we discuss both the advantages and shortcomings of the visual information from the cameras for longterm localization. We identify the drawbacks of traditional sparse feature-based methods for longterm localization and propose dense feature descriptions to cope with the pitfalls. We show that by leveraging the sequential nature of the recorded and live data stream from the robot within a network flow graph framework enables to remove false loop closure hypothesis and achieve more precise location estimates. This enables the robot to achieve robust topological localization in a place recognition framework. Although, our approach can handle natural driving maneuvers, the restricted graph connectivity limits its advantages for short, fragmented and more complex trajectories. We discuss a novel approach to h ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7842968-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129594-8>
Hydrological and erosion responses to man-made and natural disturbances : insights from forested catchments in South-central Chile ¤ Logging and large earthquakes are disturbances that may significantly affect hydrological and erosional processes and process rates, although in decisively different ways. Despite numerous studies that have documented the impacts of both deforestation and earthquakes on water and sediment fluxes, a number of details regarding the timing and type of de- and reforestation; seismic impacts on subsurface water fluxes; or the overall geomorphic work involved have remained unresolved. The main objective of this thesis is to address these shortcomings and to better understand and compare the hydrological and erosional process responses to such natural and man-made disturbances. To this end, south-central Chile provides an excellent natural laboratory owing to its high seismicity and the ongoing conversion of land into highly productive plantation forests. In this dissertation I combine paired catchment experiments, data analysis techniques, and physics-based modelling to investigate: 1) the effect of plantation forests on water resources, 2)…	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026309-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015366-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017966-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007367-1>
Approximate and projected natural level functions for Newton-type iterations ¤ This work is about an improvement of the so-called natural level function in the context of a globalization approach to Newtons method via damping. This refinement is established by means of employing singular weight-matrices for the level function. The modified natural level functions thus obtained accept larger steps and lead to faster convergence in general. The results are also adaptable to the context of nonlinear least squares problems subject to nonlinear equality constraints. Special emphasis is put on structured problems from a multiple-shooting context to solve boundary value problems for ODEs or to solve parameter estimation problems for ODEs. The basic ideas are also transported to the context of approximate Newton methods. An algorithmic implementation is provided by means of quasi-Newton techniques. This work deals with the improvement of the so-called natural test functions in the context of a globalization of the Newton iteration. By the hitherto not customary use of singular weight matrices, a further improvement of natural test functions is given in relation to the maximum of unnecessary small step sizes to be avoided, which leads to accelerated convergence. The results are applicable both for the numerical solution of nonlinear equation systems as well as for nonlinear least squares calculation under nonlinear equality side conditions. A special important application is the improvement of the multiple-shooting method for nonlinear boundary value problems or parameter estimation problems. A large part of the results is transferred to approximate Newton methods and algorithmically implemented in a quasi-Newton context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171693-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4479204-9>
Bayesian hierarchical space-time models with application to significant wave height ¤ This book provides an example of a thorough statistical treatment in space and time of ocean wave data. It is demonstrated how the flexible framework of Bayesian hierarchical space-time models can be applied to oceanographic processes such as significant wave height in order to describe dependence structures and uncertainties in the data. This monograph is a research book and it is in some sense cross-disciplinary. The methodology itself is firmly rooted in the statistical research tradition, based on probability theory and stochastic processes. However, the methodology has been applied to a problem within physical oceanography, analysing data for significant wave height, which are of crucial importance to ocean engineering disciplines. Indeed, the statistical properties of significant wave height are important for the design, construction and operation of ships and other marine and coastal structures. Furthermore, the book addresses the question of whether climate change has an effect of the ocean wave climate, and if so what these effects might be. Thus, this book is an important contribution to the on-going debate on climate change, its implications and how to adapt to a changing climate, with a particular focus on the maritime industries and the marine environment. This book should be of general interest to anyone with an interest in statistical modelling of environmental processes, and in particular to those with a particular interest in the ocean wave climate. It is written on a level that should be understandable to everyone with a basic background in statistics or elementary mathematics, and an introduction to some basic concepts is given in appendices for the uninitiated reader. The intended readership includes students and professionals involved in statistics, oceanography, ocean engineering, environmental research, climate sciences and risk assessment. Moreover, different stakeholders within the maritime industries such as design offices, classification societies, ship owners, yards and operators, flag states and intergovernmental agencies such as the IMO might find the results relevant	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038334-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057633-4>
Investigations of Cellular and Molecular Biophysical Properties by Atomic Force Microscopy Nanorobotics ¤ This book presents methodological and application research in detecting cellular and molecular biophysical properties based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanorobotics. Series methods for in situ label-free visualizing and quantifying the multiple physical properties of single cells and single molecules were developed, including immobilization strategies for observing fine structures of living cells, measurements of single-cell mechanics, force recognition of molecular interactions, and mapping protein organizations on cell surface. The biomedical applications of these methods in clinical lymphoma treatments were explored in detail, including primary sample preparation, cancer cell recognition, AFM detection and data analysis.

The Vector Mode in the Second-order Cosmological Perturbation Theory ¤ BEGIN: Introduction -- Basics of Cosmological Perturbation Theory -- Generation of Magnetic Fields -- Weak Lensing -- 21cm Lensing in the Dark Ages -- Summary of this Thesis. This thesis sheds valuable new light on the second-order cosmological perturbation theory, extensively discussing it in the context of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. It explores the observational consequences of the second-order vector mode, and addresses magnetic field generation and the weak lensing signatures, which are key phenomena of the vector mode. The author demonstrates that the second-order vector mode, which never appears at the linear-order level, naturally arises from the non-linear coupling of the first-order scalar modes. This leads to the remarkable statement that the vector-order mode clearly contributes to the generation of cosmological magnetic fields. Moreover, the weak lensing observations are shown to be accessible to the vector mode. On the basis of ongoing and forthcoming observations, the thesis concludes that the second-order vector mode is detectable.

Phosphate substituted dithiolene complexes as models for the active site of molybdenum dependent oxidoreductases ¤ Molybdenum dependent enzymes are involved in essential metabolic transformations in bacteria, plants, and human beings. The extreme instability of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) prevents its use as an effective treatment for patients with a Moco deficiency. Therefore, the design, develop and execute the artificial molybdenum cofactor models are essential. In the present thesis, the asymmetric molybdopterin (mpt) model precursors with oxygen functionality and various electronic structures and their Moco model complexes mimicking the natural cofactor have been synthesized and comprehensively investigated through multi-nuclear NMR, MS, IR, resonance Raman, X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis, and electrochemical methods. Notably, the asymmetrically substituted dithiolenes in this thesis are confirmed through a significant push-pull effect, which is tuning its electronic structure. The redox behavior of Moco model complexes was investigated by temperature-dependent cyclic voltammetry. Electronic and vibrational spectral studies were investigated in detail to understand substituents effect on the electronic structure of model complexes and to elucidate roles of mpt in catalysis. Since the model complexes can be considered as structural models for the Moco dependent oxidoreductases, catalytic oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions in DMSO/PPh3 were investigated. The main focus of the present thesis was achieved through the development of various synthetic routes that address phosphonate ...

Uptake and intracellular fate of polymeric nanoparticles studied by light and electron microscopy : from labeling strategies for polymers towards a correlative microscopy approach ¤ In nanomedicine, synthetic nanoscale objects are utilized as vectors to transfer pharmaceutically active compounds into particular cell types, where they are released in a controlled manner to address intracellular organelles selectively. Polymeric nanomaterials, which represent a material class of tremendous interest for drug delivery, are in focus of this present thesis. In order to study their mode-of-action and deduce comprehensive concepts of particle-cell interactions, high-performance imaging techniques represent a particularly valuable investigation platform, since they provide a direct insight into cellular uptake mechanisms as well as their intracellular distribution. For this reason, the present thesis pursues the implementation of two suitable imaging techniques providing information on a high-resolution level, i.e. fluorescence microscopy (FM) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this context, the utilization of carefully selected labeling strategies renders FM a powerful technique, which enables the unambiguous identification of the particles within their intracellular environment with an appropriate image contrast. Nonetheless, this method suffers from a poor resolution, so that individual particles cannot be sufficiently visualized. TEM, on the contrary, exhibits a resolution far beyond the particle size; however, polymeric nanomaterials do not show an appropriate image contrast alongside the cellular interior, which is a direct result of their similar electron contrasts. In this thesis, the implementation of both microscopy approaches into uptake studies is in focus, and the informative value of both methods is discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of both methods are pointed out, and it is illustrated that a comparison or even a correlation of both methods is highly beneficial to obtain a more complete insight. This discussion comprises as well different labeling strategies and experimental challenges.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014327-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290958-2>
Markov state modeling of binding and conformational changes of proteins ¤ Proteins are molecules that are essential for life and carry out an enormous number of functions in organisms. To this end, they change their conformation and bind to other molecules. However, the interplay between conformational change and binding is not fully understood. In this work, this interplay is investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the protein-peptide system Mdm2-PMI and by analysis of data from relaxation experiments. The central task it to uncover the binding mechanism, which is described by the sequence of (partial) binding events and conformational change events including their probabilities. In the simplest case, the binding mechanism is described by a two-step model: binding followed by conformational change or conformational change followed by binding. In the general case, longer sequences with multiple conformational changes and partial binding events are possible as well as parallel pathways that differ in their sequences of events. The theory of Markov state models (MSMs) provides the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049365-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045125-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170370-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168923-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186591-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4642901-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009843-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131115-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076388-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164965-5>
Impact of climate change effects on diversity and function of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria studied in large-scale mesocosm facilities ¤ The unprecedented increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) by anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution impacts on various earth system processes, commonly referred to as `climate change´ (CC). CC faces aquatic ecosystems with extreme abiotic perturbations that potentially alter the interrelations between functional autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton groups. These relations, however, modulate biogeochemical cycling and mediate the functioning of aquatic ecosystems as C sources or sinks to the atmosphere. The aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate how different aspects of CC influence community composition and functioning of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. These organisms constitute a major component of biogeochemical cycling and largely determine the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601495-0>
Biomarkers in peat-forming plants and their deposits in the northwestern German coastal area as indicators of post-glacial vegetation changes ¤ Lipid analysis of Wadden Sea sediments showed a significant component of terrestrial organic matter derived from erosion of Holocene peat layers in this highly dynamic area. In order to characterise these peats and their remnants in tidal flat sediments in a paleochemotaxonomical way recent plant material as well as different peats were selected for biomarker investigation. The occurrence and the distribution pattern of characteristic biomarkers like n-alkanes and triterpenoids show that the molecular composition of peat-forming plants corresponds to that of the lipid extracts from Wadden Sea sediments. Because the vegetation communities of the original mires react extremely sensitive to changing environmental conditions, peat deposits are the best indicators for sea level variations in the Wadden Sea. The results of the organic geochemical analysis of coastal peats can thus be used as indicators of temporal Holocene vegetation variations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035873-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185722-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009892-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160492-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155093-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4425928-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204563-0>

Being the first monograph devoted to this subject, the book addresses the classification problem for semisimple Hopf algebras, a field that has attracted considerable attention in the last years. The special approach to this problem taken here is via semidirect product decompositions into Yetter-Drinfel'd Hopf algebras and group rings of cyclic groups of prime order. One of the main features of the book is a complete treatment of the structure theory for such Yetter-Drinfel'd Hopf algebras. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4606082-0>

Arsenic and antimony in the environment : release and possible immobilization mechanisms ¤ This thesis is dedicated to the release and immobilization of As5+ and Sb5+ in contaminated geomaterials. Although the physical properties and chemical composition of the contaminated materials vary widely, the mechanisms, which control the fate of the contaminants are supposedly similar. In order to understand these mechanisms, I carried out a mineralogical and geochemical investigation of a soil, which was mixed with contaminated As-rich ash waste. With techniques including powder-PXRD, ICP-MS, sequential extractions, EMPA and synchrotron based µ-XRD and XANES, the carriers of As5+ in the fresh ash waste and soil-ash mixtures were identified and characterized. Glass particles and unburned coal particles with veinlets of As-rich calcite are the main carriers of As5+. In the soil-ash mixtures, the soluble As5+ containing phases of the ash-waste almost completely disappeared and As5+ migrated into the soil components, presumably consisting of iron oxides. In the following study, the immobilization of As5+ by iron oxides in the context of As5+ incorporation in hematite was investigated. As5+-ferrihydrite was transformed to hematite and examined by ICP-MS, powder-XRD, SEM, TEM, and EXAFS spectroscopy. The results show that As5+ can be incorporated into hematite with concentrations of 1.9 wt%. This novel immobilization mechanism encouraged me to investigate the possibility of Sb5+ incorporation into iron oxides in a subsequent study. Ferrihydrite was doped with different concentrations of Sb5+, As5+, and P5+ and transformed to more-well crystalline products. The transformation products were analyzed and characterized by ICP-MS, PXRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that Sb5+ directly controls the outcome of the ferrihydrite transformation and therefore the transformation products. These transformation products contain Sb5+ with up to 14 wt.%, exceeding an exclusive adsorption mechanism by far, suggesting structural incorporation of Sb5+ into the iron oxides.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188107-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206275-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143104-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480680-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142712-9>
Reciprocal classes of continuous time Markov Chains ¤ In this thesis we study reciprocal classes of Markov chains. Given a continuous time Markov chain on a countable state space, acting as reference dynamics, the associated reciprocal class is the set of all probability measures on path space that can be written as a mixture of its bridges. These processes possess a conditional independence property that generalizes the Markov property, and evolved from an idea of Schrödinger, who wanted to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Associated to a reciprocal class is a set of reciprocal characteristics, which are space-time functions that determine the reciprocal class. We compute explicitly these characteristics, and divide them into two main families: arc characteristics and cycle characteristics. As a byproduct, we obtain an explicit criterion to check when two different Markov chains share their bridges. Starting from the characteristics we offer two different descriptions of the reciprocal class, including its non-Markov probabilities. The first one is based on a pathwise approach and the second one on short time asymptotic. With the first approach one produces a family of functional equations whose only solutions are precisely the elements of the reciprocal class. These equations are integration by parts on path space associated with derivative operators which perturb the paths by mean of the addition of random loops. Several geometrical tools are employed to construct such formulas. The problem of obtaining sharp characterizations is also considered, showing some interesting connections with discrete geometry. Examples of such formulas are given in the framework of counting processes and random walks on Abelian groups, where the set of loops has a group structure. In addition to this global description, we propose a second approach by looking at the short time behavior of a reciprocal process. In the same way as the Markov property and short time expansions of transition probabilities characterize Markov chains, we show that a reciprocal class is characterized by imposing the reciprocal property and two families of short time expansions for the bridges. Such local approach is suitable to study reciprocal processes on general countable graphs. As application of our characterization, we considered several interesting graphs, such as lattices, planar graphs, the complete graph, and the hypercube. Finally, we obtain some first results about concentration of measure implied by lower bounds on the reciprocal characteristics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037612-6>
Stability of the large low shear velocity provinces : numerical modeling of thermochemical mantle convection ¤ We study segregation of the subducted oceanic crust (OC) at the core mantle boundary and its ability to accumulate and form large thermochemical piles (such as the seismically observed Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces - LLSVPs). Our high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the longevity of LLSVPs for up to three billion years, and possibly longer, can be ensured by a balance in the rate of segregation of high-density OC-material to the CMB, and the rate of its entrainment away from the CMB by mantle upwellings. For a range of parameters tested in this study, a large-scale compositional anomaly forms at the CMB, similar in shape and size to the LLSVPs. Neutrally buoyant thermochemical piles formed by mechanical stirring - where thermally induced negative density anomaly is balanced by the presence of a fraction of dense anomalous material - best resemble the geometry of LLSVPs. Such neutrally buoyant piles tend to emerge and survive for at least 3Gyr in simulations with quite different parameters. We conclude that for a plausible range of values of density anomaly of OC material in the lower mantle - it is likely that it segregates to the CMB, gets mechanically mixed with the ambient material, and forms neutrally buoyant large scale compositional anomalies similar in shape to the LLSVPs. We have developed an efficient FEM code with dynamically adaptive time and space resolution, and marker-in-cell methodology. This enabled us to model thermochemical mantle convection at realistically high convective vigor, strong thermally induced viscosity variations, and long term evolution of compositional fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078260-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401792-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338132-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354719-9>
Pisot substitutions and beyond ¤ This thesis consists (mainly) of three parts: At first, we define Hausdorff measures for product spaces of local fields. We look at iterated function systems on such spaces, the Hausdorff dimension of their attractor is estimated. Afterwards, model sets (respectively cut and project sets) are introduced. For point sets generated by a substitution rule, we state criteria that ensure that the point set in question is a model set. These results are applied to Pisot substitutions. It is conjectured that all (one-dimensional) point sets generated by a Pisot substitution are model sets. A list of equivalent statements for this conjecture is given. In the first part of Chapter 4 we show that the Haar measure on a product space of local fields is a Hausdorff measure (Theorem 4.56). Then, iterated function systems and their attractors are introduced. Generalising results of K. J. Falconer (on R^n), upper (Prop. 4.122) and in some cases lower (Lemma 4.126 & Props. 4.127 & 4.129) bounds for the Hausdorff dimension (as well as the box-counting dimension (Lemma 4.133)) for these attractors are derived. The main theme of Chapter 5 are model sets (cut and project sets) and Delone point sets that are generated by a substitution, and their interplay. Following Baake-Moody, the construction of a cut and project scheme for a multi-component Delone set is derived in Section 5.3. This construction is extended and modified for substitution point sets (Section 5.7.3) if there is a so-called algebraic or overlap coincidence; indeed, one obtains an extended internal space here (Prop. 5.137). The main theorem of this chapter is Theorem 5.154 which states equivalent conditions under which a substitution point set is a model set: Either the substitution has an algebraic or overlap coincidence, or there exist certain aperiodic tilings of the (extended) internal space ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304031-7>
Social engineering in the context of Cialdini's psychology of persuasion and personality traits ¤ This thesis shows that social engineering mainly relies on peripheral route persuasion and that consequently, Cialdini's principles of influence can be used to explain how social engineering attacks work. It is further shown by a comprehensive literature review that individual values of personality traits relate to social engineering susceptibility. Based on these arguments, a framework is proposed, which can help to guide future research. Suggestions to plausible relations between the personality traits of the Big 5 Theory and the principles of influence are made. These relations need to be evaluated by future research. Lastly, an integrated approach to prevention against social engineering attacks is proposed, which combines penetration tests using social engineering, security awareness trainings, and the development of a security-aware organizational culture. The methodology used in conducting this investigation is a theoretical, positive research approach. Extensive literature reviews have been conducted on social engineering, psychology of persuasion and the influence of personality traits on the success of social engineering attacks. Based on an analysis and discussion of these reviews, proposals for a new framework and a prevention approach have been developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>

Classical Analogies in the Solution of Quantum Many-Body Problems ¤ This book addresses problems in three main developments in modern condensed matter physics- namely topological superconductivity, many-body localization and strongly interacting condensates/superfluids-by employing fruitful analogies from classical mechanics. This strategy has led to tangible results, firstly in superconducting nanowires: the density of states, a smoking gun for the long sought Majorana zero mode is calculated effortlessly by mapping the problem to a textbook-level classical point particle problem. Secondly, in localization theory even the simplest toy models that exhibit many-body localization are mathematically cumbersome and results rely on simulations that are limited by computational power. In this book an alternative viewpoint is developed by describing many-body localization in terms of quantum rotors that have incommensurate rotation frequencies, an exactly solvable system. Finally, the fluctuations in a strongly interacting Bose condensate and superfluid, a notoriously difficult system to analyze from first principles, are shown to mimic stochastic fluctuations of space-time due to quantum fields. This analogy not only allows for the computation of physical properties of the fluctuations in an elegant way, it sheds light on the nature of space-time. The book will be a valuable contribution for its unifying style that illuminates conceptually challenging developments in condensed matter physics and its use of elegant mathematical models in addition to producing new and concrete results Chapter1.

Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter (FDOM) in Coastal Seas: Characterization, Biogeochemical Processes, and the Possibility of In Situ Monitoring ¤ Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major player in global biogeochemical cycles. Here, DOM was studied for the first time with optical and molecular methods in a subterranean estuary (STE) and it was compared to a surface estuary, both in Florida, USA. I hypothesized that STEs are important sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. I developed novel statistical tools for multivariate data interpretation. As a main result, I could show that coastal sediments are major sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. In the surface estuary, mixing of fresh- and seawater was the main driver for DOM concentration and composition, while in the STE microbial processing dominated over mixing. By statistically combining the results from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS), fluorescence spectroscopy and other chemical water analysis, I identified major DOM sources in the two estuarine systems. Furthermore, I proposed novel optical monitoring tools for in situ continuous monitoring in coastal systems. <engl.> Das gelöste organische Material (DOM) der Meere ist eine wichtige Komponente globaler Stoffkreisläufe.

Multifunctional Microballoons for the active and passive control of fluid-flows ¤ Functional materials, also called "Smart Materials", are described by their ability to fulfill a desired task through targeted interaction with its environment. Due to this functional integration, such materials are of increased interest, especially in areas where the increasing micronization of components is required. Modern manufacturing processes (e.g. microfluidics) and the availability of a wide variety of functional materials (e.g. shape memory materials) now enable the production of particle-based switching components. This category includes micropumps and microvalves, whose basic function is the active control of liquid flows. One approach in realizing those microcomponents as pursued by this work, enables variable size-switching of water-filled microballoons by implementing a stimulus-sensitive switching motif in the capsule's membrane shell, while being under the influence of a constant driving force. The switching motif with its gatekeeper function has a critical influence on one or more material parameters, which modulate ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274825-2>
Local earthquake tomography in Central Pacific margin of Costa Rica ¤ The Central Pacific area of Costa Rica is a convergent erosional margin, characterized by a high seismicity rate, coincident with the subduction of rough-relief ocean floor. It has generated earthquakes with magnitude up to seven in the past along the subduction megathrust and the inner-forearc faulting. This study uses the records from a temporal seismological network, consisting of on- and offshore stations, installed for a period of six months in this segment of the Middle American margin. The aim was to obtain a model of the 3-D velocity structure of the margin and to characterize the seismicity of the shallow part (< 70 km depth) of the subduction zone, with the focus on the seismogenic zone. A subset of well locatable events was selected to calculate a minimum 1-D model for the P-wave velocity. This model served as initial reference model for the subsequent 3-D inversion in a Local Earthquake Tomography, performed by inverting P- and S-wave traveltimes from 595 selected earthquakes. Several tools for resolution assessment were applied. Additionally, first-motion, double-couple focal mechanisms were determined for earthquakes originated at the plate interface, the subducting slab and the overriding plate. The results reflect the complexity associated to subduction of ocean-floor morphology and the transition from normal to thickened subducting oceanic crust...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180767-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7>
Multiphysically coupled modelling of polymer-based materials ¤ The multiphysically coupled modelling and numerical simulation of mass transport in polymeric materials is investigated. Coupled behaviour arises in these materials due to molecular interactions of the polymer chains with the transported particles or fluids. Due to these interactions, mass transport in polymers is often associated with large deformations and significant changes of the mechanical behaviour that, in turn, may lead to cracking and failure. On the other hand, this behaviour can be utilised deliberately, for example for microstructuring or in smart materials. Thus, a detailed understanding of the processes involved is necessary. In this thesis, a model for multiphysically coupled mass transport in the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics is developed. The governing equations describing two different example cases, namely, anomalous Case II diffusion and electroactive polymers, are derived from fundamental balance principles and equipped with suitable constitutive equations. For the description of Case II diffusion, a novel relation for the diffusion flux is developed that accounts for the delayed kinetics resulting from the molecular interactions and, thus, allows to describe the characteristic transport behaviour during Case II diffusion. To accurately model the processes occurring in composites of nanoporous metals filled with different types of electroactive polymers, the interface elasticity theory is extended to chemoelectromechanical coupling, yielding a framework that allows to describe deformation, electrostatics and charge carrier transport and their interactions in the bulk material and on the metal/polymer interface. These models are subsequently implemented into a finite element code and numerical studies are carried out to elucidate the models’ capabilities and provide insight into the coupled nature of the investigated phenomena.

New insights into the regulatory networks of Bacillus subtilis controlling general stress response and osmo adaptation ¤ The soil living, Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is frequently exposed to a wide variety of stress and starvation conditions in its natural environment. In order to survive under these environmental and energy stresses, the bacterium acquired a general stress response mechanism mediated by the alternative sigma factor, SigB. A wide-variety of stress conditions such as environmental stress conditions like ethanol stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, osmotic stress or limitation of glucose, oxygen, phosphate etc.; and low temperature growth induce this SigB-dependent general stress response. Though much is known about the mechanisms of activation of this general stress response, the conditions that induce the SigB regulon and its general functions, the definition of the structure of the SigB regulon is not completely clear. The SigB-dependent general stress regulon has previously been characterized by proteomic approaches as well as DNA-array based expression studies. Genome-wide expression studies performed by Price, Petersohn and Helmann defined the SigB regulon containing well above 100 target genes, however the overlapping list of target genes contains only 67 members. The differences between these studies probably result from the different strains, growth conditions, array platforms and experimental setups used in these studies. The first part of this work presents a targeted microarray analysis, which was performed to gain a better understanding ...

Randomness and Completeness in Computational Complexity ¤ This book is based on the author's Ph.D. thesis which was selected as the winning thesis of the 1999 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Competition. Dieter van Melkebeek did his Ph.D. work at the University of Chicago with Lance Fortnow as thesis advisor. This work studies some central issues in computational complexity: the relative power of time, space, and randomness in computing and verification. The author develops techniques for separating complexity classes by isolating structural differences between their complete problems.

Time-resolved spectroscopy of two-dimensional systems : from the conventional method to a novel cavity-enhanced solution ¤ The work presented in this dissertation is dedicated to the characterization of the excited state dynamics of thin films through time-resolved spectroscopy, with emphasis on developing a methodology that is able to resolve weak transient absorption signals from optically thin films. With this aim, the conventional transient absorption spectroscopy method is first utilized to characterize semiconducting monolayers and organic nanosheet semiconductors. Although these are physically thin, they present relatively strong transient absorption signals of a few mOD (units of optical density), which allows to characterize their excited state dynamics with the conventional machinery, not needing further signal enhancements or complex noise-minimizing techniques. Nonetheless, the former does not represent the reality of detecting the transient photoexcited dynamics of few-layered systems. For this reason, the last chapter of this thesis introduces a new approach for the sensitive detection of two-dimensional samples with marginal molecular extinction coefficients: A novel methodology that multiplies the interaction length of the light with the sample, designated cavity ring-down transient absorption spectroscopy (CRD-TAS). Being at the present time in the midst of its development, the prospect efficiency and working capabilities of the novel CRD-TAS technique are hereby evaluated, and the strategies for further improvements are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158812-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1216131074> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042096-6>
Self-action of laser beams in photorefractive crystals with external applied AC or DC electric fields ¤ The purpose of the dissertation work is to study theoretically and experimentally the influence of the additional photoelastic contribution to the modulation of the optical properties by the space-charge field and the effect of the optical activity on self-focusing and self-bending of laser beams. We have developed a theoretical model of self-action of one-dimensional light beams in (1 1 0) and (1 1 -2)-cut photorefractive sillenite crystals of point group 23 taking into account the additional contribution of the photoelastic effect to the optical properties of the medium, the induced birefringence and the optical activity. The additional photoelastic contribution to the optical properties of the photorefractive cubic medium in some cases can reduce the necessary value of the electric field amplitude by a factor of 1.7 to observe the same magnitude of the self-action effect as in existing theoretical models. The presented theoretical model predicts the possibility to observe quasi-solitons in cubic photorefractive crystals with a large magnitude of optical activity. The experimental and theoretical studies of the laser beam self-bending in bismuth titanium oxide crystals under applied external alternating fields showed that the self-bending magnitude, the self-bending direction and the form of the beam on the output face of the crystal can be controlled by the input polarization of propagated light if the bias field is applied along the direction [1 -1 1]. A theoretical model for the investigation of the self-bending effect in barium titanate crystal (BaTiO3) for a speckled extraordinary light beam taking into account the additional elasto-optic contribution was developed for the first time. The model shows that BaTiO3 crystals exhibit the property of positive or negative gradient lenses depending on whether the speckled laser beam propagates along the optical axis c or in the opposite direction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4348243-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4528275-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375523-9>
Anomalies within magnetic holography ¤ Within gauge/gravity duality, we study the class of four dimensional CFTs with chiral anomaly described by Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in five dimensions. In the first part of this thesis we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the metric and gauge field perturbations about electrically and magnetically charged black branes. By the gauge/gravity correspondence, this theory is dual to a particular class of field theories with a chiral anomaly, in a thermal charged plasma state subjected to a constant external magnetic field B. The QNMs are dual to the poles of the two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and axial current operators, and they encode information about the dissipation and transport of charges in the plasma. Complementary to the gravity calculation, we work out the hydrodynamic description of the dual field theory in the presence of a chiral anomaly, and a constant external B. We find QNMs exhibiting Landau level behavior, which become long-lived at large B if the anomaly coefficient exceeds a critical magnitude. Chiral transport is analyzed beyond the hydrodynamic approximation for the five (formerly) hydrodynamic modes, including a chiral magnetic wave. In the second part we consider the phase diagram at finite temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field B. At high temperatures the solution is given by the electrically and magnetically charged AdS Reissner-Nordstroem black brane, studied in first part of this thesis. For sufficiently large Chern-Simons coupling and at sufficiently low temperatures and small magnetic fields, we find a new phase with helical order, breaking translational invariance spontaneously. For the Chern-Simons couplings studied, the phase transition is second order with mean field exponents. Since the entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature we are confident that this is the true ground state which is the holographic version of a chiral magnetic spiral.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335725-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053793-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313686-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245082-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025643-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128420-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4762261-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026302-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175890-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046249-3>
Nonlinear Optics and Laser Emission through Random Media ¤ Disorder is everywhere, inherently present in nature, and is commonly believed to be a synonymous with disturbance. As a consequence, the methodical and customary study of the dynamics of the electromagnetic field, both in the linear and nonlinear optical regimes, leans to rule out it from the treatment. On the other hand, nonlinearity enriches the physical disciplines and brings them closer to reality with respect to the linear approximation. Nonlinearity allows to stimulate a wide and rich ensemble of optical responses that beautifies the role of matter in the active processes with electromagnetic fields.

When pushed together, light, disorder and nonlinearity make new and intriguing phenomena emerge. This text provides a comprehensive investigation of the role of disorder in the nonlinear optical propagation both in transparent media and lasers.

A methodology for numerical fatigue analysis of carbon fiber reinforced plastics ¤ BEGIN Abstract: The main focus of this thesis is the development of a non-linear, energy dependent fatigue damage model for carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). To achieve this task, the fatigue behavior of carbon fiber reinforced plastics was investigated using online stiffness measurements.<br>Existing quasi-static and fatigue models were assessed based on their potential to accurately describe the observed phenomenology.

New synthetic routes towards well-defined polypeptides, morphologies and hydrogels ¤ Proteins are natural polypeptides produced by cells; they can be found in both animals and plants, and possess a variety of functions. One of these functions is to provide structural support to the surrounding cells and tissues. For example, collagen (which is found in skin, cartilage, tendons and bones) and keratin (which is found in hair and nails) are structural proteins. When a tissue is damaged, however, the supporting matrix formed by structural proteins cannot always spontaneously regenerate. Tailor-made synthetic polypeptides can be used to help heal and restore tissue formation. Synthetic polypeptides are typically synthesized by the so-called ring opening polymerization (ROP) of α-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA). Such synthetic polypeptides are generally non-sequence-controlled and thus less complex than proteins. As such, synthetic polypeptides are rarely as efficient as proteins in their ability to self-assemble and form hierarchical or structural supramolecular assemblies in water, and thus, often require...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4814882-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285058-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175278-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157708-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147308-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010542-8>
Characterization of macromolecular systems by mass spectrometry and hyphenated techniques ¤ The focus of this thesis was to gain in-depth structural information of synthetic polymers by the application of several combined techniques. The second chapter provides an overview about the influence of the polymer architecture on its characterization by mass spectrometry and complementary methods. In the third chapter, we demonstrate the use of MS, more specifically MALDI-ToF MS, which provides molar masses and dispersity values for poly(furfuryl glycidyl ether) (PFGE). The second example is the study of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAm) copolymers with glyco-monomers with specific combinations of matrices and cationization agents. The fourth chapter will combine three different examples regarding linear, star-shaped and hybrid polymers, which were analyzed by advanced techniques. The linear copolymers were analyzed by separating them according to their chemical heterogeneity using liquid absorption chromatography at critical conditions (LACCC) of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), followed by automated spotting onto a MALDI target, which was subsequently analyzed by MALDI. Secondly, star-shaped polymers: [poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-PEtOx]8 were monitored firstly by using LACCC of linear PEO as first separation dimension and furthermore injected onto an SEC column confirming the molar mass. Lastly, a hybrid PEO star-shaped polymer was investigated using MALDI to verify the complete functionality of the core with PEO arms. Finally, the last chapter will focus on the creation of a software to obtain information regarding average composition, overcoming isotopic, overlapping peaks and isobaric species from MS spectra. Moreover, the quantitative studies were carried out by correction of the mass discrimination and isotopic abundance. Consequently, advanced analytical techniques such as different ionization techniques within MS, a range of chromatographic hyphenation and computational methods are implemented for elucidating the complexity of synthetic polymers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009840-0>

Legume chemistry and the specificity of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) host races ¤ The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a complex of at least 15 genetically different host races that are native to specific legume plants but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. Despite much research, it is still unclear why pea aphid host races can accept and colonize their native host plants while non-native host races are not. To determine the changes in the host plant chemistry and their possible influence in the specificity of the pea aphid host races, we used several metabolomics aproaches on full factorial experimental set ups by infesting separately four different plant species (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum, and Vicia faba) with native and non-native pea aphid clones of various host races. Our results from the non-targeted and targeted approaches suggested that the plant species investigated have developed different complexities of chemicals to defend themselves from the attack of herbivores including phloem feeders. Our results also suggested that A. pisum clones have evolved different feeding strategies to manipulate the host plant defense signaling, reduced deterrence or toxicity, improved host quality, reduction of enemies, and improved quality of future food sources in the vicinity to perform better on these plants. We have selected a group of polar and non-polar secondary metabolites that might be associated with the discrimination and compatibility of the pea aphid host races with the different legume species used in this project. However, additional experimentation is necessary to fully understand the effects and influence of these compounds in the specificity of the pea aphid host races.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4283667-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026066-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113361-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076052-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322820-3>

Quench sensitivity of aluminium alloys : analysis of the kinetics and nature of quench-induced precipitation ¤ For aluminium alloys, precipitation strengthening is controlled by age-hardening heat treatments, including solution treatment, quenching, and ageing. Quenching is considered a critical step, because detrimental quench-induced precipitation must be avoided to exploit the full age-hardening potential of the alloy. This work presents a comprehensive report on the solid-solid phase transformation kinetics in Al alloys covering to a vast extent quench-induced precipitation during continuous cooling over a dynamic cooling rate range of ten orders of magnitude.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141105-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133897-2>
Remnants of compact binary mergers and next-generation numerical relativity codes ¤ Numerical relativity (NR) simulations are crucial for studying the coalescence of compact binaries. Based on NR data, we produce a model for the mass and spin of the remnant black hole (BH) for the coalescence of black hole-neutron star systems, discussing its crucial role in gravitational wave (GW) modeling and in the parameter estimation of the two signals GW200105 and GW200115. In the context of binary neutron star merger simulations, we perform the first systematic study comparing results obtained with various neutrino treatments, the presence of turbulent viscosity and different grid resolutions. We find that the time of BH formation after merger is heavily affected by grid resolution and turbulent viscosity. An early BH formation limits matter ejection from the accretion disc, as the BH swallows a significant portion of it. Our results indicate that more reliable kilonova light curves are obtained only if the various ejecta components are present. Moreover, robust r-process nucleosynthesis yields require inclusion of both neutrino emission and reabsorption in simulations. Advanced neutrino schemes and turbulent viscosity in simulations resolved beyond current standards appear necessary for reliable astrophysical predictions. To carry out computationally demanding simulations of growing complexity, next-generation NR codes that can efficiently leverage the latest pre-exascale many-core and heterogeneous infrastructures are required. To this end we develop GR-Athena++, a new dynamical spacetime solver built on top of Athena++, that shows high-order convergence properties and excellent parallel scalability up to O(105) cores in full 3D binary black hole (BBH) merger simulations. Finally we present GR-AthenaK, the first performance-portable spacetime solver, obtained by refactoring GR-Athena++ with the Kokkos programming model. We demonstrate the correctness and convergence properties of GR-AthenaK with BBH runs on GPUs. GR-AthenaK shows a speedup ∼50 on one GPU compared to GR-Athena++ on a single CPU core.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112491-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158119-2>

Wind power deployment in urbanised regions : an institutional analysis of planning and implementation ¤ There is a palpable tension between the planning and implementation of climate targets, for instance as regards renewable energy resources - among which wind power plays a significant role. This tension comes to the fore when assessing the effectiveness of spatial planning approaches to the deployment of wind energy. Planning approaches to wind power are evaluated in three European urbanised regions: South Holland (Netherlands), Lower Austria (Austria) and East Flanders (Belgium). Each region has adopted wind energy targets and introduced zoned areas in its regional planning agenda. The theory of ‘new institutionalism’ and the comparative case study method are the two pillars of this investigation. Zoning may be considered as a form of institutional design, for the introduction of zoned areas not only determines the territorial spread of wind turbines, but also configures socio-organisational entities and actors involved in implementation (developers, local residents, consultants, and public authorities). The comparative approach demonstrates that planning choices in the three case studies often yield to the concerns of higher governance levels, clearly prioritising energy policy goals above local, contextual values. In consequence, ‘zones for wind energy’ do not always gain public acceptance at the local level. Indeed, the foundation for locally supported wind energy zones is laid down in the planning process itself. This process has the potential to institutionalise a trade-off between collective purposes at a higher governance level and locally changing contexts and values. On the other hand, planning agents need to be more aware of path dependencies in spatial decisions concerning renewable energy. One of the wider implications of the planning approaches studied is that they restrict, rather than promote development. Thus, when zoned areas had to be redrawn, local opposition or ‘unwillingness’ seriously restricted the amount of leeway for reaching a consensus about alternative locations. The reason was that the formal planning exercise (zoning wind energy) implied more than an impartial territorial designation: it also communicated social consensus on land-use decisions of ´where wind turbines would come´ and ´where they would not´	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056763-1>
Integrating economic costs into global biodiversity conservation priorities : sensitivity of prioritization to the use of differing cost indicators ¤ Protected area systems that are ecologically representative and effectively managed are essential tools for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity worldwide. However, global protected area coverage and management effectiveness is highly insufficient, even in areas of global biodiversity significance. Under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), governments committed to improve management effectiveness and expand the global coverage of protected areas from 13% to 17% of land area by 2020, targeting especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity. It is important that the management of protected areas is effective in order to conserve biodiversity and promote the sustainable use of resources. The management of protected areas is a crucial factor for the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of resources. Therefore, it is important that the management of protected areas is effective and that the global coverage of protected areas is improved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382886-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032579-9>

Settlement and history in Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine Galilee : an archaeological survey of the Eastern Galilee ¤ Uzi Leibner aims to provide the most accurate picture possible of the nature and history of the rural settlement in the Lower Galilee during Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods when this region played an important role in the development of both Judaism and Christianity. In an attempt to draw a historical reconstruction based on systematic data, a test case area in the »heart« of ancient Galilee was chosen for this research. Uzi Leibner used two distinct disciplines: the study of the relevant historical sources and the advanced archaeological field survey. Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic sources concerning settlements in the region were translated and discussed. Some fifty archaeological sites from the periods under discussion were identified and surveyed. The analysis of the finds enabled the author to draw a detailed portrait of settlement - including periods of construction, abandonment, prosperity and decline in each site and in the region as a whole. This book sheds new light on major historical issues such as the origins of the Galilean Jewry in the Second Temple Period, the First Jewish Revolt and its outcomes, the Jews of Galilee under Christian regime, demography, economy, continuity and decline	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054858-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071507-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129464-6>
The role of partial melting on trace element and isotope systematics of granitic melts ¤ Partial melting is a first order process for the chemical differentiation of the crust (Vielzeuf et al., 1990). Redistribution of chemical elements during melt generation crucially influences the composition of the lower and upper crust and provides a mechanism to concentrate and transport chemical elements that may also be of economic interest. Understanding of the diverse processes and their controlling factors is therefore not only of scientific interest but also of high economic importance to cover the demand for rare metals. The redistribution of major and trace elements during partial melting represents a central step for the understanding how granite-bound mineralization develops (Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994). The partial melt generation and mobilization of ore elements (e.g. Sn, W, Nb, Ta) into the melt depends on the composition of the sedimentary source and melting conditions. Distinct source rocks have different compositions reflecting their deposition and alteration histories. This specific chemical “memory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130581-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074836-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318699-3>
The Influence of Demographic Stochasticity on Population Dynamics : A Mathematical Study of Noise-Induced Bistable States and Stochastic Patterns ¤ The dynamics of population systems cannot be understood within the framework of ordinary differential equations, which assume that the number of interacting agents is infinite. With recent advances in ecology, biochemistry and genetics it is becoming increasingly clear that real systems are in fact subject to a great deal of noise. Relevant examples include social insects competing for resources, molecules undergoing chemical reactions in a cell and a pool of genomes subject to evolution. When the population size is small, novel macroscopic phenomena can arise, which can be analyzed using the theory of stochastic processes. This thesis is centered on two unsolved problems in population dynamics: the symmetry breaking observed in foraging populations, and the robustness of spatial patterns. We argue that these problems can be resolved with the help of two novel concepts: noise-induced bistable states and stochastic patterns	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046803-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133628-8>
Tomographic-interferometric method for measuring and optimizing the sound fields of multi-transducer systems for acoustic-optical void detection in historical wall paintings ¤ To inspect the bonding of historically valuable wall paintings a laser-optical vibration measurement method based on Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) has proved quite powerful. Its further development requires an acoustic excitation system in the audio range of high directivity. A parametric acoustic system was built for this purpose, where highly directional audio sound is produced by nonlinear effects from directionally radiated ultrasound. Initially, these sound fields showed unexpected properties. Their causes were identified and solutions to overcome them were developed. For this purpose it was necessary to know the 3D ultrasonic field in front of the transducer array. The ESPI-measuring method was enhanced accordingly for the investigation of sound fields. The results were used to specifically modify the ultrasonic field to obtain the desired high directivity in the audio range. The characteristics of the final parametric system are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121611-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4770404-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182122-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064542-3>
Power decay in the scrape-off layer of Wendelstein 7-X ¤ Divertor, Infrared, Plasma, Plasma boundary layer, Stellarator, Thermography, Power decay, Wendelstein 7-X, divertor, scrape-off layer, stellarator, thermography, wetted area In this work, studies with respect to the exhaust problem were performed in the stellarator experiment Wendelstein 7-X with different target concepts and different magnetic field geometries. Different infrared cameras were used to study the heat flux from the plasma onto the PFC. In the first publication, the limiter set-up was used with a simpler magnetic topology in the plasma edge. The radial fall-off of the parallel heat flux for inboard limiters in W7-X shows, similar to inboard limiters in tokamaks, two different radial fall-off lengths, a short (narrow) one, characterizing the near-SOL, and a long (broad) characterizing the far-SOL. For the far-SOL, the heating power and connection length have been identified as the main scaling parameters, while for the near-SOL, the electron temperature close to the LCFS has been identified as the main scaling parameter. The two fall-off lengths differ by a factor 10, and the found scalings for both regimes differ from known models and experimental scalings in tokamaks. A turbulent-driven feature was discussed in the publication as a possible explanation for the behavior of the fall-off length in W7-X. The gained information and data have been further used to support many other publications, covering the symmetry of the heat loads, the energy balance of the machine, and seeding experiments. The heat exhaust in W7-X with an island divertor was studied in the second and third publication.

These functors are well-known, as are many comparision isomorphisms. However the construction we use clarifies all compatibilities between those isomorphisms.<br>To use the construction given in we define a compactification structure on a subcategory of topological spaces and establish various, well-known, base change formulas END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130706-9>

Phenomenological Structure for the Large Deviation Principle in Time-Series Statistics : A method to control the rare events in non-equilibrium systems ¤ Phenomenological structure for the large deviation principle -- Iterative measurement-feedback procedure for large deviation statistics -- Common scaling functions in dynamical and quantum phase transitions -- van Zon-Cohen singularity and a negative inverse temperature -- Conclusions and future perspectives. This thesis describes a method to control rare events in non-equilibrium systems by applying physical forces to those systems but without relying on numerical simulation techniques, such as copying rare events. In order to study this method, the book draws on the mathematical structure of equilibrium statistical mechanics, which connects large deviation functions with experimentally measureable thermodynamic functions. Referring to this specific structure as the “phenomenological structure for the large deviation principle”, the author subsequently extends it to time-series statistics that can be used to describe non-equilibrium physics. The book features pedagogical explanations and also shows many open problems to which the proposed method can be applied only to a limited extent. Beyond highlighting these challenging problems as a point of departure, it especially offers an effective means of description for rare events, which could become the next paradigm of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330658-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4425827-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171730-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1>
Excitation Spectra of Square Lattice Antiferromagnets : Theoretical Explanation of Experimental Observations ¤ BEGIN: Introduction -- Variational Study of the Square Lattice Anti-ferromagnet Magnetic Zone-Boundary Anomaly -- Modeling the Spin-Wave Dispersion of Insulating Cuprate Materials. This thesis presents a qualitative advance in our understanding of quantum effects in layered magnetic materials. The nearest neighbor Heisenberg ferromagnetic ranks among the oldest and most fundamental models of quantum many body effects. It has long been established that in one dimension quantum fluctuations lead to a quantum disordered ground state with fractional excitations called spinons. In two dimensions, the ground state of the Heisenberg model displays static order and to first approximation the dynamics can be described as semi-classical spin waves. Through theoretical advances the author demonstrates that at high energy around particular points in reciprocal space these semi-classical spin-waves deconfine into fractional excitations akin to the one-dimensional spinons. He thereby provides the first explanation of a long-standing experimental observation. In the second half of his thesis Bastien Dalla Piazza develops a unified description of the magnetic excitation spectra of a range of cuprate parent compounds to the high temperature superconductors.

Improving network inference by overcoming statistical limitations ¤ A reliable inference of networks from data is of key interest in many scientific fields. Several methods have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network. These techniques rely on statistical methods, typically controlling the number of false positive links, but not considering false negative links. In this thesis new methodologies to improve network inference are suggested. Initial analyses demonstrate the impact of falsepositive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links on the resulting inferred network. Consequently, revealing the importance of making well-considered choices leads to suggest new approaches to enhance existing network reconstruction methods. A simulation study, presented in Chapter 3, shows that different values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links should be used in order to reliably estimate network characteristics.

Fluorescent nanoparticles for ion sensing ¤ In this work the synthesis and characterization of small, stable and fluorescent poly-(acrylamide) NPs for sensing of chloride ions and pH is presented. The NPs were prepared by inverse microemulsion polymerization and characterized regarding their structural and fluorescence properties. Nearly all of the described NPs formed stable colloidal solutions in water and possessed a small diameter, sufficient monodispersity and a neutral surface-potential. Two different kinds of sensor particles were prepared: chloride-sensitive NPs with a physically entrapped indicator fluorophore and pH-sensitive NPs with a covalently bound indicator dye. The co-polymerization of a reference dye enabled ratiometric measurements in suspensions with both types of nanosensors. The nanosensors showed good response to the respective analyte, although the sensitivity was reduced by incorporation of the fluorophores inside the polymer matrix. The polymer matrix protected the fluorophores from undesired interaction with proteins and at the same time allowed small ionic analytes to pass through the polymer. The chloride nanosensors were transferred into living cells and their response was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. After transfection of the cells, the NPs were located partially in small cellular organelles (endosomes) as well as in the cytosol. In order to enhance the cellular uptake and to force the endosomal escape of the NPs, different methods of functionalization were evaluated. Therefore, novel core-shell NPs with pH-independent size and a positive ?-potential were developed. Both, a pH-indicator fluorophore and a reference dye were co-polymerized to enable ratiometric pH-sensing. The signal magnitude in suspension was not as good as for the poly(acrylamide) NPs, although a clear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the pH was obtained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154838-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175085-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147794-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189273-2>
Applications of Bayesian networks in natural hazard assessments ¤ Although quite different in occurrence and consequences, from a modeling perspective many natural hazards share similar properties and challenges. Their complex nature as well as lacking knowledge about their driving forces and potential effects make their analysis demanding: uncertainty about the modeling framework, inaccurate or incomplete event observations and the intrinsic randomness of the natural phenomenon add up to different interacting layers of uncertainty, which require a careful handling. Nevertheless deterministic approaches are still widely used in natural hazard assessments, holding the risk of underestimating the hazard with disastrous effects. The all-round probabilistic framework of Bayesian networks constitutes an attractive alternative. In contrast to deterministic proceedings, it treats response variables as well as explanatory variables as random variables making no difference between input and output variables. Using a graphical representation Bayesian networks encode the dependency relations between the variables in a directed acyclic graph: variables are represented as nodes and (in-)dependencies between variables as (missing) edges between the nodes. The joint distribution of all variables can thus be described by decomposing it, according to the depicted independences, into a product of local conditional probability distributions, which are defined by the parameters of the Bayesian network. In the framework of this thesis the Bayesian network approach is applied to different natural hazard domains (i.e. seismic hazard, flood damage and landslide assessments). Learning the network structure and parameters from data, Bayesian networks reveal relevant dependency relations between the included variables and help to gain knowledge about the underlying processes. The problem of Bayesian network learning is cast in a Bayesian framework, considering the network structure and parameters as random variables itself and searching for the most likely combination of both, which corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP score) of their joint distribution given the observed data. Although well studied in theory the learning of Bayesian networks based on real-world data is usually not straight forward and requires an adoption of existing algorithms. Typically arising problems are the handling of continuous variables, incomplete observations and the interaction of both. Working with continuous distributions requires assumptions about the allowed families of distributions.

Isogeometric analysis based on Geometry Independent Field approximation (GIFT) and Polynomial Splines over Hierarchical T-meshes ¤ This thesis addresses an adaptive higher-order method based on a Geometry Independent Field approximation (GIFT) of polynomial/rationals plines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT/RHT-splines). In isogeometric analysis, basis functions used for constructing geometric models in computer-aided design (CAD) are also employed to discretize the partial differential equations (PDEs) for numerical analysis. Non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) are the most commonly used basis functions in CAD. However, they may not be ideal for numerical analysis where local refinement is required. The alternative method GIFT deploys different splines for geometry and numerical analysis. NURBS are utilized for the geometry representation, while for the field solution, PHT/RHT-splines are used. PHT-splines not only inherit the useful properties of B-splines and NURBS, but also possess the capabilities of local refinement and hierarchical structure. The smooth basis function properties of PHT-splines make them suitable for analysis purposes. While most problems considered in isogeometric analysis can be solved efficiently when the solution is smooth, many non-trivial problems have rough solutions. For example, this can be caused by the presence of re-entrant corners in the domain. For such problems, a tensor-product basis (as in the case of NURBS) is less suitable for resolving the singularities that appear since refinement propagates throughout the computational domain. Hierarchical bases and local refinement (as in the case of PHT-splines) allow for a more efficient way to resolve these singularities by adding more degrees of freedom where they are necessary. In order to drive the adaptive refinement, an efficient recovery-based error estimator is proposed in this thesis. The estimator produces a recovery solution which is a more accurate approximation than the computed numerical solution. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical investigations with PHT-splines of higher order and continuity prove that the proposed method is capable of obtaining results with higher accuracy, better convergence, fewer degrees of freedom and less computational cost than NURBS for smooth solution problems. The adaptive GIFT method utilizing PHT-splines with the recovery-based error estimator is used for solutions with discontinuities or singularities where adaptive local refinement in particular domains of interest achieves higher accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. This method also proves that it can handle complicated multi-patch domains for two- and three-dimensional problems outperforming uniform refinement in terms of degrees of freedom and computational cost.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7718401-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4376916-0>
Stability and robustness in data-driven predictive control ¤ Spray polymerisation has a long time been discussed as a promising process, yet, with little knowledge on cause-and-effect relationships between drying and chemical reactions. This work develops a new single droplet model of combined solution drying and free radical homopolymerisation, based on the method of moments. New, consistent approaches for momentsâ diffusion and the reaction-diffusion system are derived to ensure conservation. Simulations reveal peculiarities of the process such as that, due to drying, polymerisation happens mostly in bulk and monomer evaporation leads to a poor yield. Various process variants and simulation models are discussed. The impact of process parameters is examined by means of numerical DoEs. The second part presents a novel approach for the simulation of structure evolution in suspension drying. The meshfree SPH method is used to model the relevant physical effects on a detailed scale during the first and second drying period. New implementations of physical effects are derived: heat and mass transfer based on linear driving forces, an implicit solution of the heat equation, several approaches for crust formation and a new formulation of surface tension by pairwise forces. The formation of dense structures as well as hollow granules can be simulated. Model parameters influence crust formation during the second drying period concerning shape and microporosity and can be interpreted in a physical sense	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177447-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133165-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126481-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1135937567> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056693-6>
Poly(ionic liquid) stabilizers and new synthetic approaches ¤ The main focus of the present thesis was to investigate the stabilization ability of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in several examples as well as develop novel chemical structures and synthetic routes of PILs. The performed research can be specifically divided into three parts that include synthesis and application of hybrid material composed of PIL and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), thiazolium-containing PILs, and main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. In the first chapter, a vinylimidazolium-type IL was polymerized in water in the presence of CNFs resulting in the in situ electrostatic grafting of polymeric chains onto the surface of CNFs. The synthesized hybrid material merged advantages of its two components, that is, superior mechanical strength of CNFs and anion dependent solution properties of PILs. In contrast to unmodified CNFs, the hybrid could be stabilized and processed in organic solvents enabling its application as reinforcing agent for porous polyelectrolyte membranes. In the second part, PILs and ionic polymers containing two types of thiazolium repeating units were synthesized. Such polymers displayed counterion dependent thermal stability and solubility in organic solvents of various dielectric constants. This new class of PILs was tested as stabilizers and phase transfer agents for carbon nanotubes in aqueous and organic media, and as binder materials to disperse electroactive powders and carbon additives in solid electrode in lithium-ion batteries. The incorporation of S and N atoms into the polymeric structures make such PILs also potential precursors for S, N - co-doped carbons. In the last chapter, reactants originating from biomass were successfully harnessed to synthesize main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. An imidazolium-type diester IL obtained via a modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction underwent transesterification with diol in a polycondensation reaction. This yielded a polyester-type PIL which CO2 sorption properties were investigated. In the next step, the modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction was further applied to synthesize main-chain PILs according to a convenient, one-step protocol, using water as a green solvent and simple organic molecules as reagents. Depending on the structure of the employed diamine, the synthesized PILs after anion exchange showed superior thermal stability with unusually high carbonization yields. Overall, the outcome of these studies will actively contribute to the current research on PILs by introducing novel PIL chemical structures, improved synthetic routes, and new examples of stabilized materials. The synthesis of main-chain imidazolium-type PILs by a modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction is of a special interest for the future work on porous ionic liquid networks as well as colloidal PIL nanoparticles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046704-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548899-1>
Development of biomechatronic devices for measurement of wrenches occurring in animal and human prehension ¤ Biomechatronics and biosensors, especially, support the emergence of new applications based on biological inspiration across the entire range from automotive engineering to bio-robotics. Here, mechatronics, technological knowledge, biomimetics, and biology are combined. There is a market trend towards the use of intelligent sensors. In the past the main reasons for this have been increased measurement accuracy, programmability, decreased inventory cost from the larger turndown available, and a decreased maintenance cost for self-diagnostics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4798356-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017975-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158131-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006888-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238812-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165452-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4571071-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257775-5>
Spatiotemporal, nonlinear optics and the quest for the observation of discrete light bullets ¤ In this thesis, we have made a contribution towards the development of spatiotemporal, nonlinear optics. Contributions in the field of spatiotemporal pulse generation and analysis have been driven by the quest for the observation, characterization, and understanding of various families of discrete Light Bullets (LBs) and developed in parallel to that. In this chapter we shall first give a brief summary of the results that have been obtained in this thesis and then discuss potential ramifications thereof as well as possible future directions of research, which are indicated as potentially fruitful by the results obtained here. Starting from commercial facilities for the generation of high-power, femtosecond, pulsed light sources at variable wavelengths in the near infrared we have implemented a spectral pulse shaper to generate pulses with arbitrary temporal profiles, at high peak powers, with a high throughput and without imaging aberrations. Spatial pulse shaping into a pulse with discrete orbital angular momentum was demonstrated with a discrete spiral phase plate technique. We gave an outlook onto a concept that might eventually lead to a truly spatiotemporal pulse shaping device. The concept is based on recent advances in the field of multicolor metamaterial holograms and would extend the concept of metasurface beam shaping into the spatiotemporal domain.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222149-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065317-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4243979-6>
Enzymatic synthesis and characterization of grafted polyesters and their use as steric stabilizers for cubosomes ¤ In this work, enzymatic synthesis of biodegradable polyesters followed by their grafting with saturated and unsaturated fatty acid has been undertaken. Polymer synthesis has been thoroughly investigated through comprehensive characterization as well as their self-assembled behaviour in aqueous media. Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acid grafted polyesters were additionally grafted by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in order to make them water soluble. These muligraft polymers were afterwards studied as steric stabilizers for cubic liquid crystalline nanoparticles (cubosomes) of glycerol monooleate. enzymatische Synthese; biologisch abbaubare Polymere; Nanophasenseparation; Glycerolmonooleat; Cubosomen; sterische Stabilisatoren In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden biologisch abbaubare Polyester durch enzymatische Synthese hergestellt und durch Pfropfung mit gesättigten und ungesättigten Fettsäuren modifiziert.

Cardenolide diversity and toxicity in tri-trophic interactions ¤ Natural selection is expected to drive evolution towards a small number of the most beneficial chemical defences. However, in the genus Asclepias there is a high diversity of cardenolides, a compound class that target the Na+/K+—ATPase enzyme. The specialised herbivores of Asclepias are hypothesised to impose selection for chemical defences. One major objective of this thesis was to test whether cardenolides in the seeds of Asclepias curassavica defend against the specialist seed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. For this, ten compounds were isolated from A. curassavica seeds, three of those new and seven previously reported. Glucopyranosyl frugoside is the most abundant cardenolide in this tissue, and there was a significant variation in the compounds’ inhibition of the unadapted Na+/K+—ATPase. To test whether the variability in cardenolides in the seeds could represent the plant's response to selection by O. fasciatus; cardenolide analysis of the seeds and O. fasciatus was combined with tests of the inhibitory capacity of a subset of compounds against of O. fasciatus and a non-adapted insect target sites. Frugoside and gofruside were more concentrated in the bugs than is available in their diet and had contrasting potency toward the O. fasciatus target site. Thus, the accumulation of these compounds could not be explained by their availability in seeds or the biological activity on the bug’s target site. To test an alternative hypothesis that the plant chemodiversity and sequestration patterns of O. fasciatus are explained by natural selection by the third trophic level. The inhibitory properties of cardenolides in O. fasciatus were tested against several predator target sites. Glucopyranosyl frugoside and frugoside were toxic for both resistant and sensitive predators, whereas gofruside had varying degrees of inhibitory capacity. This differential effect suggests that predators can contribute to defence diversification in both milkweed plants and milkweed herbivores.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332493-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4366835-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147339-5>

Energy efficiency in manufacturing systems ¤ Energy consumption is of great interest to manufacturing companies. Beyond considering individual processes and machines, the perspective on process chains and factories as a whole holds major potentials for energy efficiency improvements. To exploit these potentials, dynamic interactions of different processes as well as auxiliary equipment (e.g. compressed air generation) need to be taken into account. In addition, planning and controlling manufacturing systems require balancing technical, economic and environmental objectives. Therefore, an innovative and comprehensive methodology--with a generic energy flow-oriented manufacturing simulation environment as a core element--is developed and embedded into a step-by-step application cycle. The concept is applied in its entirety to a wide range of case studies such as aluminum die casting, weaving mills, and printed circuit board assembly in order to demonstrate the broad applicability and the benefits that can be achieved	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329079-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140388-5>
The Tumor Suppressor APC/CCdh1 and its Role in the Emergence of Replication Stress and Genetic Instability ¤ Abstract: Introduction: Progression through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by different cyclin-dependent kinases and their activating cyclin subunits. Stage-specific proteolysis of cyclins and other cell cycle regulators is important for transition to the next cell cycle phase. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that controls mitosis and G1 through degradation of these proteins. Through its activating subunits Cdh1 and Cdc20 the APC/C assures substrate-specifity. While Cdc20 regulates progression through mitosis, Cdh1 is activated in late mitosis to coordinate accurate entry into S-phase. Thereby, the APC/C is crucial for maintaining genomic stability during the cell cycle.<br>Results: Characterization of a Cdh1-kd revealed strong stabilization of the substrates cyclin A/B leading to diminished loading of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins on replication origins in G1. Stabilization of cyclin A/B may cause the observed premature entry into S-phase, while the reduced loading of MCMs in G1 could be responsible for the prolonged replication in S-phase seen in Cdh1-kd cells. Plk1 was stabilized in Cdh1-kd cells, which may cause bypass of the Cdh1-Plk1 dependent DNA damage checkpoint. Indeed, potential replication stress in Cdh1-kd cells did not lead to G2/M arrest, but was enforced by inhibition of the Cdh1 substrate Plk1. Underreplicated DNA and replication intermediates in mitosis may be the reason for increased genomic instability, namely lagging chromosomes, anaphase bridges and micronuclei in Cdh1-kd cells detected by live-cell imaging. Monitoring of 53BP1, a DNA-repair marker, in living cells could also prove amplified DNA-damage through increased double-strand breaks in Cdh1-kd cells. In addition, aberrant cytokinesis and the development of tetraploid cells generated by misseparation of chromosomes during mitosis were enhanced in Cdh1-kd cells.<br>Conclusions: Downregulation of the tumor suppressor APC/C-Cdh1 leads to deregulation of DNA-replication by stabilizing cyclin A and B in G1 and reduced loading of replication origins with MCM proteins resulting in enhanced genomic instability	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7534837-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326903-5>

Semantics-based automatic geospatial service composition ¤ Although it has become common practice to build applications based on the reuse of existing components or services, technical complexity and semantic challenges constitute barriers to ensuring a successful and wide reuse of components and services. In the geospatial application domain, the barriers are self-evident due to heterogeneous geographic data, a lack of interoperability and complex analysis processes. Constructing workflows manually and discovering proper services and data that match user intents and preferences is difficult and time-consuming especially for users who are not trained in software development. Furthermore, considering the multi-objective nature of environmental modeling for the assessment of climate change impacts and the various types of geospatial data (e.g., formats, scales, and georeferencing systems) increases the complexity challenges. Automatic service composition approaches that provide semantics-based assistance in the process of workflow design have proven to be a solution to overcome these...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112526-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1027750397> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314515-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240291-8>

Black slate : surface alteration due to fungal activity ¤ Black slates of different oxidation states and graphite samples as pure carbon source were incubated with the white-rot fungus Schizophyllum commune 4-39 for 3 months. Investigations by SEM showed fungal affinity to rough surfaces. Oxidatively weathered, bleached black slate samples have more micropores and increased surface roughness than unweathered samples. Unpolished and polished bleached black slate samples were colonized best by fungal hyphae. The hyphae often entered pores. Etch pits induced by fungal activity could be observed which were then quantified by vertical scanning interferometry (VSI). The etch pits measured 3 4 ?m in width and 180 200 nm in depth. In contrast to black slate samples, more etch pits were found on graphite surfaces. Moreover, they showed a more elongated morphology and branches reminiscent of fungal growth morphology. Under laboratory conditions, Schizophyllum commune was able to degrade about 0.03 ?m3/?m2 rock material during 3 months of incubation. It could be shown that collapsed hyphae material remained in their etch pits even after sample preparation which was caused by strong fungal fixation to the rock surfaces. The higher carbon content and the softness of pressed graphite thus allow for earlier fungal attachment and higher dissolution rates. Amounts of nitrogen could be proved by chemical analyzing techniques (x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microprobe) at all incubated rock samples. Nitrogen increased eminently on rock surfaces due to fungal colonization. Amounts of nitrogen were detected both on hyphae and former hyphae attachment areas. This indicates the presence of fungus and/or fungal excreted proteins such as hydrophobins for attachment or enzymes for degradation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157161-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221680-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126782-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039197-8>

Optimal pilot bus selection for the secondary voltage control using parallelism ¤ The scientific monograph submitted deals with the subject of power system set and its control on the secondary level. The power system can be characterized due to its size, complexity and load unknown in advance, in addition to time variability. Since large electric power is transferred, even small changes in setting can frequently represent significant economic savings. Regarding the power system properties as well as the basics of secondary control, it is obvious that the optimal selection of pilot bus plays an important role in the quality of control and the related economic impact. The monograph focuses on the methods of optimal selection of the pilot buses for the dispatch control of bus voltage in a complex power system. The aim is to modify them so that it is possible to investigate the issue via using the parallelism principle and grid computer structure aimed at multiple shortening of the computing time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182084-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/103238512X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179034-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193615-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265092-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123127-2>

Chemically mediated plankton interactions : Prevalence, uptake, and targets of polyunsaturated aldehydes ¤ Diatoms are key players in the aquatic ecosystem as they significantly contribute to photosynthetic carbon assimilation and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. Some of these single celled algae produce polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), which are derived from enzymatic oxidation of fatty acids. These aldehydes are known to inter¬fere with the reproduction of their predators and have been suggested to act as info- and allelochemicals. Compared to the biological functions of PUAs, their mechanisms of action have been less investigated. Here, I present PUA quantification data for plankton communities and provide experimen¬tal results for an enhanced mechanistic understanding of these oxylipins. To perform the studies, I estab¬lished fluorescent probes according to the activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) strategy on the basis of PUAs and bioinactive saturated aldehydes. I developed key methodological approaches (feeding and two-step incubation protocols, procedures for fluoescence microscopy) and a novel probe reporter that is a useful and universal tool in chemical biology. Uptake studies showed that the PUA-derived probe entered algal cells and accumulated in the gonads of a predator. Moreover, investigation of targets based on covalent reactions with PUAs revealed several labeled proteins in a diatom. This first proteomic approach suggests that key metabolic pathways are affected by PUAs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292866-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030509-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186368-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046229-8>
Environmental controls on hydrological processes in fen peatlands ¤ Over the last century, peatlands have undergone severe degradation. Nevertheless, the restoration of drained peatlands has gained much importance over the last decades. Hydrological processes are closely linked to soil properties and as such investigations of both water dynamics and soil properties are vital.

Changing susceptibility of flood-prone residents in Germany : mental coping and mitigation behaviour in the context of different flood types ¤ Floods are among the most costly natural hazards that affect Europe and Germany, demanding a continuous adaptation of flood risk management. While social and economic development in recent years altered the flood risk patterns mainly with regard to an increase in flood exposure, different flood events are further expected to increase in frequency and severity in certain European regions due to climate change. As a result of recent major flood events in Germany, the German flood risk management shifted to more integrated approaches that include private precaution and preparation to reduce the damage on exposed assets. Yet, detailed insights into the preparedness decisions of flood-prone households remain scarce, especially in connection to mental impacts and individual coping strategies after being affected by different flood types. This thesis aims to gain insights into flash floods as a costly hazard in certain German regions and compares the damage driving factors to the damage driving factors of river floods.

Influence of Methylglyoxal on the Maillard Reaction during Baking Process and in Vivo [Cumulative Dissertation] ¤ Maillard reaction, Advanced Glycation Endproducts, methylglyoxal, bread, baking process, 2-acetyl-1-pyrrolin, collagen Maillard processes in food or in vivo are connected to negatively associated protein modifications, so called Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs). The cellular glycolysis, ubiquitously located in the cytoplasm, seems to be the main source of methylglyoxal, a highly reactive 1,2-dicarbonyl compound within the Maillard reaction cascade. In the present study, comprehensive mechanistic knowledge of AGE formation in both bakery products and collagen was gained. For both matrices, efficient protocols for protein extraction, solubilization and hydrolysis were developed. Connective tissue was profiled for collagen-bound AGEs and the glycation compound MOLA was identified as a novel amide AGE crosslink in vivo. In parallel, the portfolio of AGEs in wheat bread rolls and other bread types was significantly enlarged on a quantitative basis. In addition, a convenient quantitation method for the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrrolin was developed and successfully applied to various food matrices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168628-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396972-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4767145-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4628066-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164652-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034873-8>

Complexity and control in quantum photonics : doctoral thesis accepted by the University of Bristol, UK ¤ This work explores the scope and flexibility afforded by integrated quantum photonics, both in terms of practical problem-solving, and for the pursuit of fundamental science. The author demonstrates and fully characterizes a two-qubit quantum photonic chip, capable of arbitrary two-qubit state preparation. Making use of the unprecedented degree of reconfigurability afforded by this device, a novel variation on Wheeler's delayed choice experiment is implemented, and a new technique to obtain nonlocal statistics without a shared reference frame is tested. Also presented is a new algorithm for quantum chemistry, simulating the helium hydride ion. Finally, multiphoton quantum interference in a large Hilbert space is demonstrated, and its implications for computational complexity are examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4842734-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705961-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4243979-6>

RT-Level power-gating models optimizing dynamic leakage-management ¤ Power-gating is the most promising run-time technique in order to reduce leakage currents in sub-100nm CMOS devices but its application is associated with numerous problems. Overhead costs occur, the targeted circuit is slowed down, and in general the total impact of the power-gating technique is hard to predict at early design stages. The goal of this thesis is to develop power-gating models for functional units at RT-level to enable design tradeoffs and to optimize the high-level synthesis for the use of this design technique. Main contributions of this work are models for estimating the functional unit’s energy demand during active and sleep state as well as during a state transition, optimized scheduling, binding, and allocation approaches to increase the profitability of power-gating, and a consistent design flow of the high-level synthesis decisions to subsequent design tools. The models estimate the energy reduction of functional RT-level components to be 46% in average. The optimized synthesis approaches can even further reduce the remaining energy demand by up to 43% at an average reduction of 19.8%. <engl.> Power-gating is the most promising run-time technique in order to reduce leakage currents in sub-100nm CMOS devices but its application is associated with numerous problems.

Geochemical and hydraulic modeling of cavernous structures in potash seams ¤ Salt deposits offer a variety of usage types. These include the mining of rock salt and potash salt as important raw materials, the storage of energy in man-made underground caverns, and the disposal of hazardous substances in former mines. The most serious risk with any of these usage types comes from the contact with groundwater or surface water. It causes an uncontrolled dissolution of salt rock, which in the worst case can result in the flooding or collapse of underground facilities. Especially along potash seams, cavernous structures can spread quickly, because potash salts show a much higher solubility than rock salt. However, as their chemical behavior is quite complex, previous models do not account for these highly soluble interlayers. Therefore, the objective of the present thesis is to describe the evolution of cavernous structures along potash seams in space and time in order to improve hazard mitigation during the utilization of salt deposits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020198-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025362-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225478-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154649-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461775-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163048-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120557-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163055-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026307-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4722593-2>
Theory and application of induced higher order color aberrations ¤ Induced aberrations in general are higher-order aberrations caused by ray perturbations of lower order, picked up surface by surface in the preceding optical system. Therefore, induced aberration coefficients are depending on the cumulative preexisting aberrations in the system. In case of color aberrations, induced influences are already observable in the paraxial regime, since even paraxial rays are affected by dispersion. Hence, in every optical system small perturbations in ray heights and ray angles for paraxial rays of different wavelengths are present. These ray perturbations generate induced color aberration effects of higher-order. Here, different orders refer to the paraxial ray dependency on dispersion. The linear or 1st-order terms result in the well-known Seidel contributions of axial and lateral color, where any interaction of dispersion between different lenses is neglected. Starting at 2nd-order terms, induced color effects are present. In this thesis, an introduction on the basic idea of induced color aberrations is given, followed by a surface resolved analytical description for 2nd-order axial and lateral color as well as for the chromatic variations of the five Seidel aberrations. A differentiation between induced and intrinsic parts is derived and discussed. Illustrated by descriptive academic systems as well as by a complex microscopic design example, the importance and the influences of induced color aberrations for optical systems is demonstrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132894-2>
Variational source conditions, quadratic inverse problems, sparsity promoting regularization : new results in modern theory of inverse problems and an application in laser optics ¤ The book collects and contributes new results on the theory and practice of ill-posed inverse problems. Different notions of ill-posedness in Banach spaces for linear and nonlinear inverse problems are discussed not only in standard settings but also in situations up to now not covered by the literature. Especially, ill-posedness of linear operators with uncomplemented null spaces is examined. Tools for convergence rate analysis of regularization methods are extended to a wider field of applicability. It is shown that the tool known as variational source condition always yields convergence rate results. A theory for nonlinear inverse problems with quadratic structure is developed as well as corresponding regularization methods. The new methods are applied to a difficult inverse problem from laser optics. Sparsity promoting regularization is examined in detail from a Banach space point of view. Extensive convergence analysis reveals new insights into the behavior of Tikhonov-type regularization with sparsity enforcing penalty.--	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186951-5>

Magneto-structural characterization of polynuclear complexes with supramolecular architectures ¤ The thesis describes the supramolecular organization of homo- and heteropolynuclear complexes, containing different paramagnetic centers, going from d-block metal ions to combination of d-f spin carriers topologies. These polynuclear complexes have been structurally and spectroscopically characterized, and partly magnetostructural correlations have been performed. The synthesis of polynuclear complexes has been based on self-assembly and rational strategies. Iron(iii) aza-crown complexes have been isolated through self-assembly reaction between N-imidazol-2-yl-salicyloyl hydrazide and FeX3·xH2O salts in presence of pseudo-halide coligands. These complexes are characterized by antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe(iii) centers. In addition, self-assembly of easy accessible Schiff base ligands and d-block metal salts led to homo-polynuclear d-complexes with the magnetic interaction varying from strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic centers to ferromagnetic interaction induced by accidental orthogonality of the magnetic orbitals associated to d-metal ions in partial-cubane structural core. The rational strategy approach is divided in two subcategories, namely the dendritic approach and ʺcomplex-as-ligandʺ strategy. The dendritic approach is based upon C3-symmetric triaminoguanidine-Schiff base ligand derivatives which present three-fold tridentate coordination pockets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133952-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169306-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054424-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208977-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166199-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142666-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038906-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114489-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173291-1>

Revisiting prosodic reconstruction : an interface-based approach to partial focus and topic fronting in German ¤ In this thesis, I develop a theoretical implementation of prosodic reconstruction and apply it to the empirical domain of German sentences in which part of a focus or contrastive topic is fronted. Prosodic reconstruction refers to the idea that sentences involving syntactic movement show prosodic parallels with corresponding simpler structures without movement. I propose to model this recurrent observation by ordering syntax-prosody mapping before copy deletion. In order to account for the partial fronting data, the idea is extended to the mapping between prosody and information structure. This assumption helps to explain why object-initial sentences containing a broad focus or broad contrastive topic show similar prosodic and interpretative restrictions as sentences with canonical word order. The empirical adequacy of the model is tested against a set of gradient acceptability judgments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020717-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047500-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003961-4>
Modeling past, present and future climate induced vegetation changes in East Africa ¤ East Africa is a natural laboratory: Studying its unique geological and biological history can help us better inform our theories and models. Studying its present and future can help us protect its globally important biodiversity and ecosystem services. East African vegetation plays a central role in all these aspects, and this dissertation aims to quantify its dynamics through computer simulations. Computer models help us recreate past settings, forecast into the future or conduct simulation experiments that we cannot otherwise perform in the field. But before all that, one needs to test their performance. The outputs that the model produced using the present day-inputs, agreed well with present-day observations of East African vegetation. Next, I simulated past vegetation for which we have fossil pollen data to compare. With computer models, we can fill the gaps of knowledge between sites where we have fossil pollen data from, and create a more complete picture of the past. Good level of agreement between model and pollen data ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187459-6>
Computational Analysis of Argumentation Strategies ¤ The computational analysis of argumentation strategies is substantial for many downstream applications. It is required for nearly all kinds of text synthesis, writing assistance, and dialogue-management tools. While various tasks have been tackled in the area of computational argumentation, such as argumentation mining and quality assessment, the task of the computational analysis of argumentation strategies in texts has so far been overlooked. This thesis principally approaches the analysis of the strategies manifested in the persuasive argumentative discourses that aim for persuasion as well as in the deliberative argumentative discourses that aim for consensus. To this end, the thesis presents a novel view of argumentation strategies for the above two goals. Based on this view, new models for pragmatic and stylistic argument attributes are proposed, new methods for the identification of the modelled attributes have been developed, and a new set of strategy principles in texts according to the identified attributes is presented and explored. Overall, the thesis contributes to the theory, data, method, and evaluation aspects of the analysis of argumentation strategies. The models, methods, and principles developed and explored in this thesis can be regarded as essential for promoting the applications mentioned above, among others.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041354-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116579-2>
Centrifugal microfluidics for nucleic acid analysis at the point-of-care ¤ The analysis of nucleic acid sequences is the basis for the initiation of evidence-based therapies for many infectious, genetic, and hereditary diseases, especially when they present with non-specific symptoms or sequence patterns on the nucleic acid strand are associated with a pathological indication. Compared to conventional culture-based methods, nucleic acid analysis provides an obvious benefit in specificity and reduction in time-to-result. In time-critical situations and in settings where access to centralized laboratory-based diagnostics is limited, nucleic acid analysis, conducted directly at the “point-of-care” would be desired. However, the complex workflow for analysis, typically comprising cell lysis, nucleic acid purification, amplification, and detection, hinders the automation in portable systems and consequently only a few point-of-care systems are available. The aim of this thesis was the development of a centrifugal microfluidic cartridge for nucleic acid analysis that potentially could be operated at the point-of-care. To achieve this goal, several sub-goals including the development of a process chain for nucleic acid extraction and for multiplex nucleic acid amplification were defined. These process chains were finally co-integrated on one cartridge for sample-to-answer nucleic acid analysis. Initially, a unit operation for transportation of magnetic beads between several microfluidic chambers was developed. Here, bead transport was solely depending on the azimuthal position of the cartridge with respect to a locally fixed, external permanent magnet, ‘transport magnet’. This implementation allowed an isoradial arrangement of the microfluidic chambers thereby circumventing one of the basic limitations for integration of complex assays on the centrifugal microfluidic cartridge: the arrangement of consecutive assay steps in radial direction from the cartridge center towards the rim. Yield of bead transport through three microfluidic chambers was measured to 82.6 % ± 3.6 %. With this unit operation, DNA from Listeria innocua lysates and lambda phages was purified with recoveries of up to 68 % ± 24 % and 43 % ± 10 %, respectively, compared to manual reference. The unit-operation was then completed by a second external permanent magnet, ‘collection magnet’, to collect beads in liquid volumes as large as 1 mL before they are transported out of the liquid into the adjacent microfluidic chamber. The unit operation was then integrated into a centrifugal microfluidic and the results were compared with those of the manual reference. The results showed that the centrifugal microfluidic represents an efficient and automated method for nucleic acid analysis at the point-of-care. The developed unit operation enabled the efficient transport and collection of particles, which is an important step in the development of a centrifugal microfluidic cartridge for nucleic acid analysis. The results of this work show that the centrifugal microfluidic is a promising technology for nucleic acid analysis at the point-of-care and that the developed unit operation is an important step in the development of a centrifugal microfluidic cartridge for nucleic acid analysis. The results of this work can serve as a basis for the development of centrifugal microfluidic cartridges for nucleic acid analysis at the point-of-care.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803438-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172117-2>
The Effect of the international community presence in the urban development of post conflict city : case study: Kosovo ¤ Post Conflict Reconstruction is a very complex topic, whether it is to be undertaken by the Local or the International Community. The process of the Post Conflict Development is to be very hard to investigate, primarily for the combination of socio-cultural phenomena, war and political instability; having difficulties of conducting solid empirical analysis (obtaining reliable data) and dealing with war-torn communities. The multifaceted process of the reconstruction is ought to touch a lot of countries vital segments, whereas each of them requires different approach; coordination with one another; and unification in their common aim. The emergency of the assistance programs are not equal, same as with the priority and weight when compared with each other, therefore occasionally there are programs for the success of which the other less important actions are violated or neglected. The case is with the International Community presence ( the set up), which aside from their mission and projects, it is considered to play a very important role on the urban development of a post conflict city; the setting was never planned or considered in a holistic manner, therefore IC establishment was done ad hoc and it was guided by issues which did not help at its greatest to the urban development of the city and more over to the citizens who were most in need. The study is about the Urban Development, due to the fact that the biggest concentration of the International Community is likely to be in the urban centers, and the experienced changes are of a much considerable magnitude. The reconstruction phase is likely to be lasting at about 10 years and more , consequently the International Community for that time being tends to be recognized as temporary citizens of the city, and it is inevitably that they will be having an impact on the urban development of the city; in that basis it is considered to be significant that the International Community Establishment/Set Up be included into the International Organizations mission and assist in the overall mission of the reconstruction.

Induction of Altered Metabolite Profiles in Streptomycetes by Environmental Factors: Cocultivation of Streptomyces avermitilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens and Streptomyces coelicolor under Heavy Metal Ion Stress ¤ The cultivation with non kind microorganisms induces the production of antibacterial secondary metabolites in microbes. In S. avermitilis such reaction could be monitored by analyzing the frequently observed guttation droplets, which might serve as reservoir for secondary metabolites in streptomycetes and fungi. Analyses showed that S. avermitilis formed guttation droplets mainly contained sucrose. S. avermitilis produced the sucrose from the nutrients of the medium. As reaction coculture with P. fluorescens the reduction of available sucrose amount was detected. This suggests that the sucrose could serve as energy storage, which is mobilized under the competitive pressure in the mixed culture. As well as non kind microorganisms have certain metal ions a stimulating effect on the secondary metabolism of streptomycetes. Therefore, the effects of cobalt ion stress Streptomyces coelicolor were characterized systematically. Relatively high concentration of cobalt ion in the medium induced the differentiation of a red and a blue colored phenotype of S. coelicolor. GC-MS analysis indicates that the two pigmented phenotypes produce a volatile profile different from the wild type. The volatile emission of S. coelicolor was characterized by the reduction of terpene release under cobalt ion stress.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180520-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7519610-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183669-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221594-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128256-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138579-2>
Biocatalytic cascades for the production and detection of flavor and fragrance compounds ¤ Biokatalyse, Natural product, alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehydes, biocatalytic cascades, biosensor, glycosidases, natural products This thesis focuses on the establishment of biocatalytic cascade reactions for the production and detection of industrially relevant flavor and fragrance compounds for food and cosmetic products. To meet the consumer’s demand for those products to be natural, environmentally friendly biocatalytic manufacturing processes that operate GMO-free must be established. Thus, this thesis presents such pathways for the production of an industrially relevant long-chain hydroxy fatty acid and the important flavor and aroma compound raspberry ketone. Furthermore, a biosensor for aldehyde detection was implemented to facilitate screening for suitable biocatalysts that produce industrially relevant aldehydes that are widely applied in the flavor and fragrance industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137070-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113361-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4393622-2>
Spin dynamics in two-dimensional quantum materials : a theoretical study : doctoral thesis accepted by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain ¤ This thesis focuses on the exploration of nontrivial spin dynamics in graphene-based devices and topological materials, using realistic theoretical models and state-of-the-art quantum transport methodologies. The main outcomes of this work are: (i) the analysis of the crossover from diffusive to ballistic spin transport regimes in ultraclean graphene nonlocal devices, and (ii) investigation of spin transport and spin dynamics phenomena (such as the (quantum) spin Hall effect) in novel topological materials, such as monolayer Weyl semimetals WeTe2 and MoTe2. Indeed, the ballistic spin transport results are key for further interpretation of ultraclean spintronic devices, and will enable extracting precise values of spin diffusion lengths in diffusive transport and guide experiments in the (quasi)ballistic regime. Furthermore, the thesis provides an in-depth theoretical interpretation of puzzling huge measured efficiencies of the spin Hall effect in MoTe2, as well as a prediction of a novel canted quantum spin Hall effect in WTe2 with spins pointing in the yz plane.

Event Classification in Liquid Scintillator Using PMT Hit Patterns : for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Searches ¤ BEGIN Theory -- The SNO+ Experiment -- Reconstruction -- Backgrounds -- Pulse Shape Discrimination for Internal Backgrounds -- Pulse Shape Discrimination of External Backgrounds -- The OXO Signal Extraction Framework -- 0νββ Extraction -- Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay with Slow Scintillator -- Conclusions -- Appendices The search for neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the highest priority areas in particle physics today; it could provide insights to the nature of neutrino masses (currently not explained by the Standard Model) as well as how the universe survived its early stages. One promising experimental approach involves the use of large volumes of isotope-loaded liquid scintillator, but new techniques for background identification and suppression must be developed in order to reach the required sensitivity levels and clearly distinguish the signal. The results from this thesis constitute a significant advance in this area, laying the groundwork for several highly effective and novel approaches based on a detailed evaluation of state-of-the-art detector characteristics. This well written thesis includes a particularly clear and comprehensive description of the theoretical motivations as well as impressively demonstrating the effective use of diverse statistical techniques. The professionally constructed signal extraction framework contains clever algorithmic solutions to efficient error propagation in multi-dimensional space. In general, the techniques developed in this work will have a notable impact on the field END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1168054532> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171615-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180794-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4442272-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4500393-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147494-6>
Optical design for far-field light shaping ¤ Different solutions for far-field light shaping are reviewed. For design algorithms based on geometric optics, typically, a mapping between the irradiance distribution of the input and the target is assumed. In this thesis, the validity of the mapping assumption is analyzed from a physical-optics point of view. It is revealed that it is true only when all the operators in the system modeling are pointwise operators. With the physical-optics modeling techniques, a design strategy is provided that starts from a functional design and continues with a structural design. By applying the inverse method, the light-shaping problem is reduced to a Fourier pair synthesis. For the Fourier pair synthesis, a mapping-type algorithm is introduced in the homeomorphic case. In the proposed method, the solution of the mapping between the Fourier pair is integrable. Therefore, the output wavefront phase can be achieved in a single integration step. After designing the output wavefront phase, the functional embodiment is nothing other than a wavefront phase response (WPR) function. The structural design of light-shaping elements is developed with the obtained WPR function, or more directly with the output wavefront phase. The design of both a holographic optical element (HOE) and a freeform lens for light shaping is demonstrated. The element function of the HOE design is the same as the WPR function. The local grating model is then derived from its element function. A hybrid component by adding a curved surface to the HOE is suggested to reduce the grating effects from the HOE. For the design of a freeform lens, an algorithm is proposed that combines the output wavefront phase design and the construction of the freeform surface in an iterative way. The algorithm has no restriction about the input wavefront and the shape of the predefined surface. Moreover, the Fresnel effect of the freeform surface is also considered in the design.

Bacterial Production of Tailored Wax Esters: Use of Plant Oil and Individual Components as Carbon Source and Wax Ester Precursor ¤ The bacterial production of tailored wax esters (WE) from plant oil and other organic compounds was demonstrated using the bacterium Alcanivorax jadensis T9. Previous screening of more than 50 marine bacteria had shown that many of them produced WE on incubation with different plant oils. WE produced on rapeseed oil (RP) resembled WE in human sebum. Selected n-fatty acid, n-alcohol, n-alkane or triacylglyceride substrates led to the formation of WE with their acid and alcohol moieties mainly directly derived from the substrates. Additional WE of different chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation showed that the bacterium shortened, elongated or desaturated the substrate’s carbon chains before WE synthesis. n-Alcohols were most suitable considering the amounts of WE produced. Two-component mixtures revealed selective WE metabolism. n-Alcohols plus RP led to variable amounts of WE and an extended WE spectrum compared to n-alcohols alone. Tripalmitate, RP or n-hexadecene with C16 substrates reduced WE production compared to the C16 compounds alone. Research in this field should aim at an industrial use of specifically tailored WE e. g. in skin care or medicine.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137154-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316357-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153062-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171332-1>
Integrated development in Post Apartheid South Africa : a socio-political perspective of the "IDP" in regard to spatial planning in Nyanga and Philippi Township, Cape Town ¤ The intention of this thesis is to analyse the performance of the theory and the practice of the integrated development planning by Cape Town&rsquo;s local government in two Townships named Nyanga and Philippi between 1999 and 2001. Since then the local government aimed to supply a planning approach that is of an integrative nature, opposed to the disintegrative one during Apartheid before 1994. South Africa's primary instrument for development is named the Integrated Development Plan (IDP). This instrument is primarily responsible for socioeconomic development but significantly affects and considers spatial planning aspects as well. Between 1999 and 2001 the five selected project cases along the Ingulube Drive in Nyanga and Philippi under the umbrella of the Dignified Places rogramme have been implemented. The study analysis aims to investigate a specific momentum in time, where spatial practice in South Africa began to experience a new, integrative approach. Furthermore, the study is embedded in the planning conventions in Cape Town's black Townships before, during and after Apartheid. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4673746-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0>

Modeling of III-nitride alloys by ab-initio methods ¤ BEGIN: Modern parameter-free calculations using many-body approaches are actually the state-of-art in theory of condensed matter physics. The enormous effort dedicated to the ab initio description of the properties of materials is increasing exponentially based on advances of calculations taking the quasiparticle electronic structure, excitonic effects and local field effects into consideration. In this work, it was modeled properties of group-III nitrides and their alloys by means of ab initio methods. The ground-state (energetic, structural, elastic) and excited-state (energy bands, band parameters, dielectric functions) properties of the zincblend and the wurtzite polytypes of AlN, GaN, InN, and their “wurtzitic” alloys InxGa1-xN and InxAl1-xN are investigated within a cluster expansion approach using density functional theory together with the AM05 exchange-correlation functional. The total energies and the optimized atomic geometries of all 22 clusters classes of the cluster expansion for each compound are calculated. The computationally demanding calculation of the corresponding quasiparticle electronic structures is achieved for all cluster classes by means of a recently developed scheme to approximately solve the quasiparticle equation based on the HSE06 hybrid functional and the G0W0 approach. Using two different alloy statistics, strict-regular solution model and microscopic decomposition model, the configurational averages are calculated. The composition-dependent electronic structures of the alloys are discussed based on configurationally averaged properties of the ground and excited states. The influence of the alloy statistics on the composition dependencies and the corresponding bowing parameters of the band gaps is found to be significant and should, hence, lead to different signatures in the optical-absorption or -emission spectra of these Materials.

The effect of groundwater on benthic primary producers and their interaction ¤ In littoral zones of lakes, multiple processes determine lake ecology and water quality. Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD), most frequently taking place in littoral zones, can transport or mobilize nutrients from the sediments and thus contribute significantly to lake eutrophication. Furthermore, lake littoral zones are the habitat of benthic primary producers, namely submerged macrophytes and periphyton, which play a key role in lake food webs and influence lake water quality. Groundwater-mediated nutrient-influx can potentially affect the asymmetric competition between submerged macrophytes and periphyton for light and nutrients. While rooted macrophytes have superior access to sediment nutrients, periphyton can negatively affect macrophytes by shading. LGD may thus facilitate periphyton production at the expense of macrophyte production, although studies on this hypothesized effect are missing. The research presented in this thesis is aimed at determining how LGD influences periphyton, macrophytes, and the interactions ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140346-0>

The formation of molecular clouds and stars by turbulent compression and collapse ¤ The goal of this work is to improve our understanding of the role of interstellar turbulence in star formation. In particular, the mechanism of turbulence energy injection, the turbulence forcing, is investigated with hydrodynamical simulations. In a systematic comparison, I study the two limiting cases of turbulence forcing: solenoidal (divergence-free) forcing and compressive (curl-free) forcing. I show that these two cases yield significantly different gas density and velocity statistics. The fractal structure of the gas and the turbulent density probability distribution function (PDF) are explored in detail. I find that compressive forcing yields a three times higher standard deviation of the roughly Gaussian density PDF. I discuss the impact of this result on analytic models of star formation ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7614195-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117265-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042805-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186472-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705983-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061232-6>
Pasture use of mobile pastoralists in Azerbaijan under institutional economic, farm economic and ecological aspects ¤ Beweidung, Betriebsanalyse, Institutionenökonomie, Degradation, Azerbaijan, social-ecological systems, mobile livestock, common pool resources, case study Against the background of post-socialist transition and nationwide economic growth in Azerbaijan this dissertation analyses the utilisation of rangeland resources by mobile pastoralists in Azerbaijan. The study was motivated by the initially scarce knowledge about pastoralism in Azerbaijan and concerns about declining pasture condition due to growing livestock numbers. The study was guided by three research objectives, which were addressed cumulatively in five publications. The first objective aims at analysing the development of pastoralism in the transition period in comparison to developments in the pastoral sectors of other post-socialist countries. Secondly, the study addresses socio-economic causes of inappropriate pasture management by pastoralists. Finally, in an application-oriented research process recommendations for improving the management of pastoral farms and pasture governance were developed in order to mitigate inappropriate pasture management. For addressing these objectives the study frames the management of rangelands as a complex natural resource management system, in which the environment, users, governance structures, and the socio-political context are closely linked. Within this framework, the study focused especially on pastoral farms using a farm economics approach and on pasture governance with employing institutional economic theories. Regarding the methodology, a case study approach in four study regions was chosen in order to deal with the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043208-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200268-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027208-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006164-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112745-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140286-8>

Modeling and executing batch activities in business processes ¤ Business process automation improves organizations’ efficiency to perform work. Therefore, a business process is first documented as a process model which then serves as blueprint for a number of process instances representing the execution of specific business cases. In existing business process management systems, process instances run independently from each other. However, in practice, instances are also collected in groups at certain process activities for a combined execution to improve the process performance. Currently, this so-called batch processing is executed manually or supported by external software. Only few research proposals exist to explicitly represent and execute batch processing needs in business process models. These works also lack a comprehensive understanding of requirements. This thesis addresses the described issues by providing a basic concept, called batch activity. It allows an explicit representation of batch processing configurations in process models and provides a corresponding execution [...]	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237203-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139337-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4325683-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9>

Influence of river reconstruction at a bank filtration site : water quality field investigation and 3D modelling of groundwater flow and heat transport ¤ Bank filtration is an effective water treatment technique and is widely adopted in Europe along major rivers. It is the process where surface water penetrates the riverbed, flows through the aquifer, and then is extracted by near-bank production wells. By flowing in the subsurface flow passage, the water quality can be improved by a series of beneficial processes. Long-term riverbank filtration also produces colmation layers on the riverbed. The colmation layer may act as a bioactive zone that is governed by biochemical and physical processes owing to its enrichment of microbes and organic matter. Low permeability may strongly limit the surface water infiltration and further lead to a decreasing recoverable ratio of production wells.The removal of the colmation layer is therefore a trade-off between the treatment capacity and treatment efficiency. The goal of this Ph.D. thesis is to focus on the temporal and spatial change of the water quality and quantity along the flow path of a hydrogeologically heterogeneous riverbank filtration site...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276981-4>
Measurement of the Antineutrino Double-Differential Charged-Current Quasi-Elastic Scattering Cross Section at MINERvA ¤ This thesis represents the first double differential measurement of quasi-elastic anti-neutrino scattering in the few GeV range--a region of substantial theoretical and experimental interest as it is the kinematic region where studies of charge-parity (CP) violation in the neutrino sector most require precise understanding of the differences between anti-neutrino and neutrino scatter. This dissertation also presents total antineutrino-scintillator quasi-elastic cross sections as a function of energy, which is then compared to measurements from previous experiments. Next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, hope to measure CP violation in the lepton sector. In order to do this, they must dramatically reduce their current levels of uncertainty, particularly those due to neutrino-nucleus interaction models. As CP violation is a measure of the difference between the oscillation properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos, data about how the less-studied antineutrinos interact is especially valuable. The measurement described herewith determines the nuclear and instrumental effects that must be understood to undertake precision neutrino physics. As well as being useful to help reduce oscillation experiments' uncertainty, this data can also be used to study the prevalence of various correlation and final-state interaction effects within the nucleus. In addition to being a substantial scientific advance, this thesis also serves as an outstanding introduction to the field of experimental neutrino physics for future students.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171617-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171615-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190024-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170940-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223195-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059318-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1>

Currently, it is not possible to predict the pandemic potential of avian influenza A viruses. We now describe a new mouse model suitable for risk assessment. It is based on the finding that innate restriction factors represent effective species barriers that need to be overcome by viruses trying to invade a human host. In mice, innate immune control of influenza viruses is mediated by the interferon-regulated Mx1 gene. The MX1 orthologue of humans (encoding MxA protein) provides broad resistance to influenza and other viruses in cell culture systems. MxA is targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses which encapsidates the viral genome and is pivotal to virus replication. Influenza A viruses that successfully established stable lineages in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the nucleoprotein that allow partial MxA escape in cell culture experiments. Our new mouse strain lacks functional endogenous Mx genes but instead carries the human MX1 locus as transgene. Our transgenic mice were largely resistant to highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses, but were almost as susceptible to infection with influenza viruses of human origin as non-transgenic littermates. We further demonstrate that an engineered avian H7N7 influenza virus carrying a nucleoprotein with signature mutations typically found in human virus isolates was more virulent in transgenic mice than the parental virus. These findings illustrate that a few amino acid changes in the viral nucleoprotein can mediate escape from MxA restriction in vivo. They further suggest that equivalent mutations need to be acquired by any emerging influenza A viruses before they can cause a pandemic. ...

Supersymmetry : from quantum mechanics to lattice field theories ¤ Supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems in arbitrary dimensions on curved spaces with nontrivial gauge fields are considered. The square of the Dirac operator serves as Hamiltonian. Supersymmetry can be used to solve for zero modes of the Dirac operator which is illustrated for the Kahler spaces CPn̂. Furthermore, a special supersymmetric quantum mechanical system is investigated, the supersymmetric hydrogen atom with its corresponding super-Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. Finally, Wess-Zumino models in the continuum and on spatial lattices, which result in high dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems, are discussed in detail. The normalizable zero modes of the models with N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry are counted and constructed in the weak- and strong-coupling limits. Together with known methods from operator theory this gives us complete control of the zero mode sector of these theories for arbitrary coupling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128574-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330914-8>

From condensed matter to Higgs physics : solving functional renormalization group equations globally in field space ¤ By means of the functional renormalization group (FRG), systems can be described in a nonperturbative way. The derived flow equations are solved via pseudo-spectral methods. As they allow to resolve the full field dependence of the effective potential and provide highly accurate results, these numerical methods are very powerful but have hardly been used in the FRG context. We show their benefits using several examples. Moreover, we apply the pseudo-spectral methods to explore the phase diagram of a bosonic model with two coupled order parameters and to clarify the nature of a possible metastability of the Higgs-Yukawa potential.In the phase diagram of systems with two competing order parameters, fixed points govern multicritical behavior. Such systems are often discussed in the context of condensed matter. Considering the phase diagram of the bosonic model between two and three dimensions, we discover additional fixed points besides the well-known ones from studies in three dimensions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that in certain regions of the phase diagram, two universality classes coexist. To our knowledge, this is the first bosonic model where coexisting (multi-)criticalities are found. Also, the absence of nontrivial fixed points can have a physical meaning, such as in the electroweak sector of the standard model which suffers from the triviality problem. The electroweak transition giving rise to the Higgs mechanism is dominated by the Gaussian fixed point. Due to the low Higgs mass, perturbative calculations suggest a metastable potential. However, the existence of the lower Higgs-mass bound eventually is interrelated with the maximal ultraviolet extension of the standard model. A relaxation of the lower bound would mean that the standard model may be still valid to even higher scales. Within a simple Higgs-Yukawa model, we discuss the origin of metastabilities and mechanisms, which relax the Higgs-mass bound, including higher field operators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177773-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297710-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496040-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132888-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331341-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154496-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151966-8>
Advanced x-ray multilayer waveguide optics ¤ The aim of this thesis was to design novel waveguide structures, and to analyze them in view of complex phenomena of near-field propagation. For this purpose, experimental far-field measurements were used in combination with finite-difference simulations and phase retrieval methods. Two novel structures have been designed, fabricated and characterized: the waveguide array (WGA), yielding several waveguided beams in transmission, and multi-guide resonate beam couplers (RBCs), tailored to yield two or several reflected beams. Two novel structures have been designed, fabricated and characterized: the WGA, yielding several waveguided beams in transmission, and multi-guide RBCs, tailored to yield two or several reflected beams. The WGA and the multi-guide RBCs are not only distinct in the coupling geometry. A major difference is related to the fact that the WGA principle is based on the separation (non coupling) of the different transmitted wavelets, while the RBC functions are based on a strong coupling of guided radiation in several layers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4739877-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189546-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065317-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178318-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154023-2>
Strain-rate sensitivity of glasses ¤ Although glasses are commonly thought of as ideal brittle materials, a local plastic deformation can be induced by the penetration of sharp objects, such as the indenter tips commonly employed for hardness testing. Since the first experimental verification of this phenomenon, considerable research effort has been devoted to the underlying microscopic mechanisms, which govern the indentation deformation of glasses, but also to associated properties of technological relevance, like crack initiation and defect tolerance, fracture toughness, brittleness or even scratchability. In early indentation studies, this has been achieved through a post-mortem topographic or spectroscopic analysis of the residual hardness imprints left on the glass surface. However, with the ongoing demand for a mechanical characterization at small-scales, advanced indentation protocols have been developed, which nowadays allow for a more comprehensive description of the fundamental deformation processes in amorphous materials and by extension, the design of more defect-tolerant glasses. But regardless of the numerous studies on the contact damage resistance of glasses, the time or rate dependence of the indentation deformation, commonly referred to as creep, still remains poorly understood. To overcome this issue, the influence of the imposed strain-rate on the hardness of a variety of glasses with covalent, ionic and metallic bonding character as well as varying degrees of network dimensionality and atomic packing density was characterized in a nanoindentation strain-rate jump test. Based on these results, a qualitative mechanistic description of the topological principles that determine the rate dependence of the glass hardness has been proposed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021142-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038893-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132276-9>
Changes in the composition of bacterioplankton communities by incubation with freshwater macrophytes Iris pseudacorus and Mentha aquatica ¤ The influence of Iris pseudacorus (yellow flag) and Mentha aquatica (water mint) on pondwater bacterioplankton communities was investigated. The plants caused qualitative as well as quantitative changes of the bacterioplankton community composition during 7d incubations of pondwater with plants as revealed by culture-independent 16S rDNA-based fingerprint analyses followed by statistical analysis of DGGE banding profiles. Compared to natural pondwater, community profiles of bacterioplankton incubated with plants showed new as well as deleted bacterial phyloptypes. While additional phylotypes presumably stemmed from plant associated bacteria, deleted phylotypes were adversely affected in the presence of plants. Tests with concentrated exsudates from incubation assays of I. pseudacorus on cultures of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas spp. confirmed antibacterial effects of plant exsudates.

Qualitative constraint-based reasoning : methods and applications ¤ Abstract: This thesis considers so-called qualitative constraint-based reasoning: qualitative information is formalized and posed as constraints to entities. Algorithms process these constraints to decide the satisfiability of the description. This approach has often been formalized by means of relation algebras, which has led to the definition of qualitative constraint calculi. In contrast, I consider the reasoning problem in the context of constraint programming. To this end, I compare the relation-algebraic approach to established alternative formalisms, such as constraint languages and first-order logic. The results illustrate shortcomings in previous work and show that a more flexible approach by means of constraint languages can be used to substitute the relation-algebraic view. Further, previously used \	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049534-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195870-6>

Photon-pair generation in photonic crystal waveguides ¤ In this thesis, I overcome the challenges and fill the gaps in knowledge for the design and analysis of photonic crystal slab waveguides (PCSWs) as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources of photon-pairs, as well as to investigate their potential for engineering the properties of the photon-pair quantum state. I have developed the required formalism for analyzing both the quantum process of SPDC and its classical counterpart of second-harmonic generation (SHG). In studying SHG, I verified my formalism through comparing its results with direct nonlinear simulations. In these formulations, special attention was given to treating lossy modes, as they prove to be an inherent part of the SPDC designs in PCSWs. Moreover, I have found a practical set of PCSW designs, phase-matched for three-wave-mixing processes, while demonstrating that PCSWs can offer a strong control over the phase-matching configuration. This includes reaching phase-matching between modes of different propagation directions, reaching simultaneous phase-matching between multiple processes, and controlling the group velocity of the modes at the point of phase-matching. These capabilities proved to be the key to discovering the unique strength of PCSWs for the SPDC application. Through the use of various phase-matching configurations, I showed how compact SPDC sources can be designed using PCSWs that are capable of creating entanglement and tuning its extent in different degrees of freedom, with specific examples for path and spectral degrees of entanglement, all in a fully integrated way and directly at the generation step. This work also includes my experimental results on characterizing lithium niobate nanostructured ridge waveguides, demonstrating phase-matched SHG. Finally, I propose the concept of atom-mediated SPDC, for interfacing a single-emitter source with a photon-pair source, relying on the bandgap evanescent modes of a periodic waveguide.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4834091-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167928-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173045-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045922-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7726957-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4587112-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267405-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1149179627> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1>
Patterns of nucleotide variation and gene-associated SNP analysis in a Quercus spp. forest at isocitrate dehydrogenase genes ¤ Genomic DNA contains the primary source of genetic information. Thus, its analysis provides the highest level of genetic resolution. DNA sequencing and genotyping methodologies based on it in particular genotyping of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) facilitated new research approaches in forest genetics. Both quantitative and population genetic methods are being applied to better understand the association between genotypic and phenotypic diversity, and to detect the signatures of natural selection upon different parts of the genome in forest trees and their populations. Oak populations have been widely used as model species to study adaptation of forest trees in variable environments due to their wide geographical range and the large variation of climatic and edaphic condition that they occupy. Four oak species that coexist in the Bejan Oak Reserve (a species rich temperate oak forest in west-central Romania) were investigated in the present study: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto. The four species are closely related, likely to hybridize and belong taxonomically to the section Quercus sensu stricto (white oaks) according to the most recent classifications. According to the geographical range of the species, the site of investigation is for the two more widely spread European species (Q. robur and Q. petraea) in the centre of their distribution, whereas for the two so called "thermophilous and xerothermic" oak species (Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto), the Bejan Oak Reserve is located at the east-northern margins of their distribution ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151140-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264352-1>

Collective Land Use as a Chance for Nature Conservation? The Example of Community Forests ¤ BEGIN Abstract: In recent years, common goods have increasingly become an object of public and scientific discourse. With regards to collective land use, a particularly interesting aspect is the extent to which interdependencies exist between ownership types and the resource utilised. This topic is addressed in this dissertation project with respect to community forests. This ownership model, by which the members possess shares of the common area and use the forest collectively, has been documented since the middle ages. In particular regions, these communities are still found in large numbers today. On the basis of their development history, management approaches and objectives, common areas can exhibit very different forest types and structures. Given that in some cases the communities still practice traditional coppicing, such areas may have significant conservation value.<br>The aim of this project was to investigate the relationships between the forest communities and structural parameters in the managed landscapes. The development and current situation of the communities were examined and a characterisation of their forests was undertaken. On this basis, the question of how the communities’ forests differ structurally from one another and from other ownership types was addressed. Here, emphasis was placed on the nature conservation value of the existing structures. Furthermore, the question of which factors determine the existing structures and whether the ownership type as such has an influence was investigated. A possible transferability of the findings to models of cooperative land and resource use was also observed.<br>These questions were examined in two study areas within the German low mountain ranges (northern Saarland, southern Rhineland-Palatinate / Westerwald, Siegerland, Sauerland, Bergisches Land). These are characterised by a wide spectrum of differently evolved community types. In particular, Heckengesellschaften, Gehöferschaften, Hauberggenossenschaften, Waldinteressentenschaften, Jahnschaften and Waldnachbarschaften were examined. Methodologically, the study consisted of two strands of research, the results of which were blended together. On the one hand, the forest communities with their development histories, operating modes and management approaches as well as their objectives and external framework conditions were examined. In addition to literature analysis, qualitative methods of empirical social research – namely expert interviews and case studies – were used. The results of the study provide insights into the relationships between the forest communities and the structural parameters in the managed landscapes. They also show how the communities’ forests differ structurally from one another and from other ownership types. The study highlights the importance of considering the ownership type and the existing structures when evaluating the nature conservation value of community forests. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the potential of community forests as a model for cooperative land and resource use.

Affine Iterated Function Systems, invariant measures and their approximation ¤ We consider Iterated Function Systems (IFS) on the real line and on the complex plane. Every IFS defines a self-similar measure supported on a self-similar set. We study the transfer operator (which acts on the space of continuous functions on the self-similar set) and the Hutchinson operator (which acts on the space of Borel regular measures on the self-similar set). We show that the transfer operator has an infinitely countable set of polynomial eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions can be regarded as generalized Bernoulli polynomials. The polynomial eigenfuctions define a polynomial approximation of the self-similar measure. We also study the moments of the self-similar measure and give recursions for computing them. Further, we develop a numerical method based on Markov chains to study the spectrum of the Hutchinson and transfer operators. This method provides numerical approximations of the invariant measure for which we give error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-distance. The standard example in this thesis is the parametric family of Bernoulli convolutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4846596-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343626-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4352361-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145587-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141470-6>
Mono- and multinuclear titanium and titanocene complexes as potential building blocks for the assembly of macromolecular structures ¤ Within this thesis new mono- and multinuclear titanium complexes as potential building blocks for the assembly of macromolecular structures have been developed. The electrochemical investigation of titanocene(II) complexes with hexaazatriphenylene-type ligands revealed different electrochemical behaviour that strongly depends on the used bridging ligand. The obtained titanium complexes with nitrogen containing carboxylate ligands showed a huge variety due to the substitution at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and number, type and coordination mode of the carboxylate ligands. An obtained titanium tris(carboxylate) complex showed temperature depending coordination dynamics. A photochemical reaction of titanocene bis(carboxylate) complexes was observed. Loss of a cyclopentadienyl radical in these reaction lead reductively from titanocene(IV)- to dinuclear titanium(III) compounds. The reaction path was confirmed by quantum chemical methods (DFT) and by NMR spectroscopic investigation. <engl.> In dieser Arbeit wurden ein- und mehrkernige Titankomplexe als potentielle Bausteine zum Aufbau makromolekularer Strukturen erhalten. Die elektrochemische Untersuchung von Titanocen(II)komplexen mit Hexaazatriphenylen-artigen Brückenliganden zeigte ein unterschiedliches elektrochemisches Verhalten, welches stark von den verwendeten Brückenliganden abhängt. Die erhaltenen Titankomplexe mit N-haltigen Carboxylatliganden zeigten eine große Vielfalt in Hinblick auf ihr Substitutionsmuster an den Cyclopentadienylliganden und Anzahl, Art und Koordinationsmodus der Carboxylatliganden.

Model-based prediction of the benefit with rehabilitative hearing devices ¤ In this thesis, auditory models were applied to rehabilitative hearing devices in order to predict their expected benefit for the user. Rehabilitative hearing devices under test were (i) three different single-microphone noise reduction algorithms and (ii) a simulated cochlear implant. The first benefit was defined as the Acceptable Noise Level with a noise reduction algorithm in comparison to the situation without an algorithm. The influence of noise reduction algorithms on the Acceptable Noise Level could partly be predicted with the Oldenburg Perception Model for the averaged data from measurements with subjects. The second benefit was defined as the restored speech recognition performance for the Oldenburg sentence test with cochlear implants in dependence on pathologic peripheral changes of the auditory system as well as on different cognitive performance for the speech perception. From the model simulations with the cochlear implant model it was concluded that an individual prediction of the speech recognition performance might be possible with a precise estimation of the number and density of surviving auditory nerve cells together with the spatial spread function of the electric field as well as the cognitive speech recognition. <engl.> In dieser Doktorarbeit wurde die Eignung von auditorischen Modellen für die Vorhersage des Nutzens von rehabilitativen Hörhilfen untersucht.

Dabei konnte der Einfluss von Störgeräuschreduktionen auf den Acceptable Noise Level zum Teil mit dem Oldenburger Perzeptionsmodel für den Mittelwert der mit Versuchspersonen gemessenen Daten nachgebildet werden. Der zweite Nutzen beschreibt die wiederhergestellte Sprachverständlichkeit für den Oldenburger Satztest bei Versorgung mit einem Cochlea-Implantat in Abhängigkeit von pathologischen, peripheren Veränderungen im auditorischen System und verschiedener kognitiver Leistung bei der Sprachverarbeitung. Gemäß Modelsimulationen waren dabei die wichtigsten Parameter die Anzahl der überlebenden Nervenzellen zusammen mit der Breite der Stromverteilungsfunktion und die kognitive Leistung bei der Spracherkennung. <dt.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343358-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4802636-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077744-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127103-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9>

Mass spectrometry based proteomics approaches unraveling dynamic processes in the entire bacterial cell ¤ Deciphering the entire protein complement of a living cell together with the elucidation of dynamic processes on protein level are the main goals of proteomics as it is used today. To achieve this goal, namely the elucidation of dynamic processes of the entire bacterial cell, we have developed strategies and distinct workflows to cover the most proteins in different subcellular localizations in bacteria together with a stable isotopes labeling approach to follow temporal and spatial changes in different proteomic subfractions. In this work, it has been shown that the use of mass spectrometry based in vivo quantitation techniques and the application of subcellular and chromatographic fractionation has lead to a new level of qualitative and quantitative proteomics data. Emphasizing on the studies revealing the dynamics of the bacterial physiology on a time resolved base, both spatial and temporal processes can be monitored to obtain knowledge on physiological processes in a depth that has not been reached before in comparable global studies.

Characterization of antimicrobial effects triggered by non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasmas on microbial biofilms relevant in food processing, preservation and packaging ¤ The here presented dissertation investigated the molecular mechanisms, by which the food industry model bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Listeria monocytogenes, grown either as planktonic cultures, were inhibited by plasma treated water (PTW) produced by a microwave-induced plasma source (MidiPLexc). As a starting point, optimal operating parameters were determined with 5 standard liters per minutes (slm) compressed air during the treatment of 10 ml deionized water within a treatment time of up to 15 min (pre-treatment time). Treatment times of 1, 3 and 5 min were selected (post-treatment time). In addition to physical parameters, i.e. temperature measurements at different spots at the plasma source during the production of the PTW, the chemical composition of PTW was determined by pH measurements, chronoamperometry (determination of the H2O2 concentration), ion chromatography (determination of the NO2-, NO3- and ONOO- concentrations) and mass spectrometry (qualitative determination of the molecules). In addition, concentration changes of reactive species over a period of 3 h indicated a decrease of the NO2- concentration as well as an increase of the NO3- and ONOO- concentration in the PTW. Microbiological assays, i.e. quantification of colony-forming units (CFU), fluorescence and XTT assays, revealed a significant reduction of the proliferation ability of the cells, membrane damages and metabolic activity have been demonstrated for planktonic cultures as well as mono- and ...

Localization and separation of concurrent talkers based on principles of auditory scene analysis and multi-dimensional statistical methods ¤ This work focuses on 'statistical cocktail party processing': localization, tracking, and enhancement of voices in concurrent speech or in high levels of nonstationary noise. Key strategies are to link binaural and spectro-temporal information, to combine cues across frequency and time by a probabilistic approach, and to treat speech as a multidimensional stochastic signal, using a priori knowledge about it. To implement these, Bayesian estimation, sequential Monte Carlo methods, and statistical evaluation of speech databases are used. Three on-line algorithms are developed and tested, which run partly in real-time. They allow for a robust, efficient and exact sound localization even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and successful tracking and separation of voices with convergence times between 50 and 200 ms. The multidimensional statistical approach allows to analyze acoustical scenes at low SNR, showing that the described strategies might help to interpret auditory processing. <engl.> Diese Arbeit behandelt statistisches 'Cocktail Party Processing': Lokalisation, Verfolgen und Hervorhebung von Stimmen in Sprachlärm oder nichtstationären Störgeräuschen mit hohem Pegel. Als Strategien dienten die Verbindung binauraler und spektro-temporaler Information, die Kombination von Merkmalen über Frequenz und Zeit anhand eines probabilistischen Ansatzes, und die Behandlung von Sprache als mehrdimensionales statistisches Signal. Hierzu wurden Bayes'sche Schätzverfahren, Sequenzielle Monte Carlo Methoden, und die statistische Auswertung von Sprachdatenbanken verwendet. Drei, teilweise in Echtzeit ausführbare, on-line Algorithmen wurden entwickelt. Sie erlauben eine robuste, effiziente und exakte Lokalisation von Schallquellen selbst bei niedrigen Signal-Rausch-Abständen (SNR) und Verfolgung und Trennung von Stimmen mit Konvergenzzeiten zwischen 50 und 200 ms.

Multiscale simulation approach for battery production systems ¤ Addressing the challenge of improving battery quality while reducing high costs and environmental impacts of the production, this book presents a multiscale simulation approach for battery production systems along with a software environment and an application procedure. Battery systems are among the most important technologies of the 21st century since they are enablers for the market success of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage solutions. However, the performance of batteries so far has limited possible applications. Addressing this challenge requires an interdisciplinary understanding of dynamic cause-effect relationships between processes, equipment, materials, and environmental conditions. The approach in this book supports the integrated evaluation of improvement measures and is usable for different planning horizons. It is applied to an exemplary battery cell production and module assembly in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential benefits of the simulation	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138914-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004687-4>

Ecological management of tropical forests: implications for climate change and carbon fluxes ¤ Tropical deforestation and forest degradation contributes to more than 20% of the global greenhouse gases emitted. Deforestation and its impacts can be more easily estimated with satellite images. Concerning forest degradation, it is difficult with the actual satellite image resolutions to evaluate accurately logging and biomass damage resulting from this activity though it contributes substantially to carbon emissions in the tropics. With increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, there is an urgent need of reliable biomass estimates and carbon pools in tropical forests, most especially in Africa where there is a serious lack of data. Moist tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to a broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa. Developing site-specific equations and pan-moist tropical equations including data from Africa is becoming very important for most ecologists for accurate estimations of this contribution extend, necessary for adaptation and mitigation strategies on climate change impacts. Allometric equations are key tools for climate change scenarios since they are used for estimating biomass and carbon pool at local, regional and world level. Information on net primary production (NPP) resulting from direct biomass field measurements of annual tree ring width is crucial in this context, to know how forest ecosystems will grow in the future with their possible impacts on carbon pools and fluxes and also to calibrate eddy covariance measurements ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164552-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122388-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006877-8>

This book discusses the legal obligations when investment advice or portfolio management services are provided through an automated system, so-called ‘robo advice’. In the first chapter, different types of robo advice are categorised and described. The second chapter focuses on the regulatory classification and the authorisation requirements of such a service. In the third chapter, statutory provisions for robo advice, particularly duties of conduct and organisational obligations, are analysed. Where legal requirements fail to address the specific characteristics of this digital service, the last chapter develops regulatory proposals de lege ferenda. Im Zuge der Digitalisierung hat der Einsatz automatisierter Systeme bei der Anlageberatung und Vermögensverwaltung, sog. Robo Advice, an Beliebtheit gewonnen. Mit dieser Beratungsform geht ein Paradigmenwechsel bei der Erbringung von Wertpapierdienstleistungen einher, da Anleger und Anbieter ausschließlich digital und ohne Beteiligung menschlicher Berater interagieren. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit werden die verschiedenen Ausprägungen von Robo Advice dargestellt und kategorisiert. Auf dieser Grundlage wird die Dienstleistung im zweiten Teil aufsichtsrechtlich qualifiziert und die Erlaubnispflichtigkeit erörtert. Im dritten Teil werden die einzelnen Verhaltens- und Organisationspflichten aufgezeigt. Dabei wird untersucht, inwieweit die allgemeinen aufsichtsrechtlichen Vorgaben den Besonderheiten der digitalen Anlageberatung und Vermögensverwaltung gerecht werden. Wo die herkömmlichen Gesetze an ihre Grenzen stoßen, werden im letzten Teil Regelungsvorschläge de lege ferenda erarbeitet.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1115819186> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002094-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063089-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120944-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003957-2>

Controlling light emission by dielectric metasurfaces ¤ The dielectric metasurfaces have been widely recognized as a low-loss platform allowing for manipulation of the near- and far-fields. However, the field of light-emitting dielectric metasurfaces is less developed. The main objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how dielectric metasurfaces can improve and control the emission of nanoscale light sources coupled to them. This includes the experimental realization of coupled photonic systems consisting of emitters and dielectric metasurfaces, development of optical setups for characterization of the emission properties, and numerical simulations to support the experimental data and to analyze the underlying physical mechanisms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4243979-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1024960048>
Subjective Private Rights and Norm Enforcement ¤ BEGIN: The private and procedural legal order is currently undergoing fundamental changes. Stefan Thönissen discusses these from a legal philosophy and dogmatic perspective and asks whether there are normative guidelines that structure the current changes and what their prospects for development are. The private and procedural legal order of the present is undergoing a process of transformation. All constituents that are central to civil law, such as person, will, freedom, subjective right, and contractual freedom, are currently under significant criticism and have become fragile. As a counter-model, a private law model is gaining broad support, which sees the essential task of civil law in regulation and behavior control. The central element of this model is the creation of sanctions-backed obligations that serve social interests, aim at behavior control, and are enforced through private litigation rights. Stefan Thönissen examines the various private law models from an idea-historical and legal-dogmatic perspective and asks whether there are normative provisions that structure the current legal change and what development prospects arise from this.

Cosmological solutions of the Einstein-Vlasov-scalar field system ¤ The aim of this thesis is to obtain as much information as possible, about global solutions of the Cauchy problem for the Einstein-Vlasov-scalar field system with spherical, plane and hyperbolic symmetries written in areal coordinates. The sources of this system are generated by both a distribution function and a linear scalar field subject to the Vlasov and wave equations respectively. This system describes the evolution of self-gravitating collisionless matter and scalar waves within the context of general relativity. We consider the cosmological case. That is spacetimes possess a compact Cauchy hypersurface and then, data are given on a compact 3-manifold. We extend the local-in-time results obtained by G. Rein for the Einstein-Vlasov system with collisionless matter alone. This extension concerns pointwise estimates for hyperbolic equations by the method of characteristics. This means that the system is transformed to a system of ordinary differential equations which are integrated along characteristics ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114294-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297175-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013941-4>

Immune-modulatory effects of non-thermal plasma ¤ Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has drawn more and more attention to the field of wound healing research during the last two decades. It is characterized by a unique composition, which includes amongst others free radicals, ions and electrons. Furthermore, non-thermal plasma exhibits temperatures that are below those inducing thermal cell damage. Next to its well-established anti-bacterial properties, plasma can have lethal as well as stimulating effects on mammalian cells. Therefore, the medical application of non-thermal plasma on chronic wounds seems to be a promising tool to enable healing processes. However, less is known about the plasma-mediated induction of intracellular signaling pathways in human immune cells, which play a leading part in the process of wound recovery and removal of pathogens. Therefore, this thesis examined the cellular effects of a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on human immune cells using the argon plasma jet kinpen 09. Here, the CD4+ T helper cell line Jurkat, the monocyte cell line THP-1 as well as the corresponding primary cells were investigated. First, cell survival and apoptosis induction was assessed in response to non-thermal plasma treatment by growth curves and flow cytometric assays. On the one hand it could be shown that primary cells are more susceptible to plasma treatment than the respective cell lines. On the other hand, monocytes responded less sensitive to plasma exposure than lymphocytes. Furthermore ...

Coiled coils as molecular force sensors for the extracellular matrix ¤ Force plays a fundamental role in the regulation of biological processes. Cells can sense the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by applying forces and transmitting mechanical signals. They further use mechanical information for regulating a wide range of cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, as well as differentiation and apoptosis. Even though it is well understood that mechanical signals play a crucial role in directing cell fate, surprisingly little is known about the range of forces that define cell-ECM interactions at the molecular level. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191346-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4734072-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7530993-2>
Controlling Light in Optically Induced Photonic Lattices ¤ Discrete periodic structures play an important role in physics, and have opened up an exciting new area of investigation in recent years. Questions relating to the control of light in such structures still represent a major challenge. It is this highly active field that is addressed in the present thesis. Using the model system of a photorefractive nonlinearity that allows one to simultaneously create and control photonic lattices by light, the author obtains a comprehensive picture of the control of nonlinear and quantum optics phenomena in photonic lattices. He describes and demonstrates experimentally for the first time resonant transitions in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices, including Rabi oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling, as well as the direct control and exploitation of these transitions. A particular highlight of this thesis is the study of soliton-cluster switching and control of Zener tunneling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121912-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4587112-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137458-7>
Sideways launching of ships using fluid-structure interaction ¤ Within this work a simulation-based approach using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) for the assessment of sideways launching of ships based on an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach is proposed. The results of the ALE approach are compared to common approaches (use of rules / regulations, analytical formulations, model tests and simulations without FSI). Based on the ALE approach two different load mechanism acting upon a ship can be observed: the impact with the water surface and the deceleration of the hull structure. The second load mechanism could only be observed based on the proposed ALE approach. In addition, the influence of different parameters of a sideways launching process is investigated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077970-1>
Artist Houses in England (around 1860) : Concept and Self-Design ¤ In this thesis, it is the great interest that artists, along with their audiences, took in the designing of their living and working environment in the 19th century that serves as a starting point. More specifically, I examine the significance of artistic engagement with the house in the period around 1860, a field proving to be particularly productive, especially in England: in an era of bourgeois prosperity and self-esteem, the house was in vogue and, consequently, was deliberately constructed as an interior. But in which regard do the strategies used to appropriate houses relate to this artistically? To what extent can it be said that the inhabitants likewise based their self-conception on such strategies? With the examples of the cottage of the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron (1815-79) on the Isle of Wight, and the London studio house of the painter Frederic Leighton (1830-96), I present two contemporaneous forms of reference in which highly different artistic concepts can be observed. In both cases, it was the house that allowed the respective artists to “establish” themselves extensively comprehensively. In der vorliegenden Arbeit nehme ich das große Interesse, das Künstlerinnen und Künstler, sowie deren Publikum, im 19. Jahrhundert der Gestaltung ihres Wohn- und Arbeitsumfeldes entgegenbrachten zum Ausgangspunkt meiner Untersuchung. Genauer frage ich nach der Bedeutung der künstlerischen Auseinandersetzung mit dem Haus in der Zeit um 1860, die sich, zumal in England, als besonders ergiebig erweist: Das Haus hat Konjunktur in einer Epoche bürgerlichen Wohlstands und Selbstbewusstseins, mit Nachdruck wird es als Interieur errichtet. Doch wie verhalten sich dazu die Strategien, mit denen sich Künstlerinnen und Künstler ihre Häuser aneigneten? Inwiefern lässt sich sagen, dass die Bewohner sich anhand dieser Strategien selbst entwarfen? Am Beispiel des zum Studio umgebauten Cottage der Photographin Julia Margaret Cameron (1815–79) auf der Isle of Wight, sowie des Londoner Atelierhauses des Malers Frederic Leighton (1830–96) stelle ich zwei zeitgleiche Bezugsformen dar, an denen sich höchst verschiedene künstlerische Konzepte beobachten lassen. Hier wie dort erlaubte es das Haus die jeweilige Künstlerschaft umfassend zu „begründen“. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252184-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143284-8>

In the fourth example, the steps required to convert an aryl iodide as a mediator from an ex-cell to a catalytic in-cell process are highlighted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151819-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151767-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151764-7>
Dijet Angular Distributions in Proton-Proton Collisions : At √s = 7 TeV and √s = 14 TeV ¤ This thesis is based on the first data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Its theme can be described as the classical Rutherford scattering experiment adapted to the LHC: measurement of scattering angles to search for new physics and substructure. At the LHC, colliding quarks and gluons exit the proton collisions as collimated particle showers, or jets. The thesis presents studies of the scattering angles of these jets. It includes a phenomenological study at the LHC design energy of 14 TeV, where a model of so-called large extra dimensions is used as a benchmark process for the senkrecht zur LHC-Achse liegenden Dijet-Angular-Verteilungen.

Communication, Knowledge Production, and Cartography: Abraham Ortelius and Map Production in Antwerp in the Late 16th Century ¤ The production of commercial maps in the renaissance can only be explained through the complex interaction of diverse unrelated factors. This can be illustrated based on the maps created by Abraham Ortelius (*1527 †1598). The structure of early modern commercial networks affected the flow of and the access to the information he needed to produce these maps significantly. Technical and economic possibilities –and constraints– determined the framework in which he operated. Methodological and cognitive processes shaped the design of his maps and came into play when selecting their content. Those maps were a product of both scholarly and artisanal endeavors. They were also an expression of a widespread humanistic philosophy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029823-1>
Ordering Phenomena in Rare-Earth Nickelate Heterostructures ¤ This thesis presents an experimental study of ordering phenomena in rare-earth nickelate-based heterostructures by means of inelastic Raman light scattering and elastic resonant x-ray scattering (RXS). Further, it demonstrates that the amplitude ratio of magnetic moments at neighboring nickel sites can be accurately determined by RXS in combination with a correlated double cluster model, and controlled experimentally through structural pinning of the oxygen positions in the crystal lattice. The two key outcomes of the thesis are: (a) demonstrating full control over the charge/bond and spin order parameters in specifically designed praseodymium nickelate heterostructures and observation of a novel spin density wave phase in absence of the charge/bond order parameter, which confirms theoretical predictions of a spin density wave phase driven by spatial confinement of the conduction electrons; and (b) assessing the thickness-induced crossover between collinear and non-collinear spin structures in neodymium nickelate slabs, which is correctly predicted by drawing on density functional theory. .

Synthesis and evaluation of pseudosaccharin amine derivates as potential elastase inhibitors ¤ Pseudosaccharin amines, Heterocycles, Elastase inhibitions, Reversible inhibitions, molecular modelling Elastase is a serine protease which by definition is able to solubilize elastin by hydrolytic cleavage.Human Leukocyte Elastase, HLE (EC 3.4.21.37), is involved in deseases such as adult respiatory distress syndrome, pulmonary emphysema, smoking related chronic bronchitits, ischemic-reperfusion injury and rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, the elastase inhibitors have clinical utility in these diseases. Heterocyclic compounds are one of the most important classes of the elastase inhibitiors. In the present work different pseudosaccharin amine derivatives were synthesized and tested against the elastase. The synthesis of pseudosaccharin amine dervatives was carried out from the amines and(1,1-dioxobenzo[d]isothiazol-3-ylsulfanyl)acetonitrile in different solvents. Futhermore, the pseudosaccharin amines were obtained by refluxing the thiosaccarinates in absolute acetic acid. The reaction of 3-ethoxybenzo[d]isothiazole 1,1-dioxide with different amines in dioxane under reflux resulted into the desired pseudosaccharin amine derivatives in higher yields. Pseudosaccharin chloride was also used in the synthesis of these derivatives ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152479-2>
Structural modelling and robustness analysis of complex metabolic networks and signal transduction cascades ¤ The dissertation covers the topic of structural robustness of metabolic networks on the basis of the concept of elementary flux modes (EFMs). It is shown that the number of EFMs does not reflect the topology of a network sufficiently. Thus, new methods are developed to determine the structural robustness of metabolic networks. These methods are based on systematic in-silico knockouts and the subsequent calculation of dropped out EFMs. Thereby, together with single knockouts also double and multiple knockouts can be used. After evaluation of these methods they are applied to metabolic networks of human erythrocyte and hepatocyte as well as to a metabolic network of Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is found that the erythrocyte has the lowest structural robustness, followed by the hepatocyte and E. coli. These results coincide very well with the circumstance that human erythrocyte and hepatocyte and E. coli are able to adapt to conditions with increasing diversity. In a further part of the dissertation the concept of EFMs is expanded to signal transduction pathways consisting of kinase cascades. The concept of EFMs is based on the steady-state condition for metabolic pathways. It is shown that under certain circumstances this steady-state condition also holds for signalling cascades. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to deduce minimal conditions for signal transduction without knowledge about the kinetics involved. On the basis of these assumptions it is possible to calculate EFMs for signalling cascades. But due to the fact that these EFMs do no longer just have mass flux but also information flux, they are now called elementary signalling modes (ESMs).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038971-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126481-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150934-1>

Insbesondere wird gezeigt, dass, wenn E ein ultrabornologischer PLS-Raum ist, eine solche Theorie genau dann existiert, wenn E die sogenannte Eigenschaft (PA) besitzt. Desweiteren werden zahlreiche Beispiele solcher Räume, die (PA) besitzen bzw. nicht besitzen, angegeben.

The effects of international peace missions on corruption : how multinational peace missions enable and constrain good governance in post-conflict-societies ¤ International peace missions face a fundamental dilemma between their aims of ending conflict and also fostering good governance. This study presents empirical evidence that more is not better in international peacekeeping: more authority vested in a peace mission yields less effectiveness in curbing corruption. Its author applies a framework that uses the intrusiveness of international peace missions to study their effects on corruption. Bridging the gap between large-N quantitative studies and single case studies, the study pursues a mixed methods design, employing statistical analyses as well as qualitative case studies of Sierra Leone, Côte D’Ivoire, Kosovo and Croatia. The analysis shows that highly intrusive peace missions are more likely to enable corruption than to constrain it. By contrast, missions with medium levels of intrusiveness are more likely to contribute to better control of corruption by acting as impartial arbitrators and by conditioning external assistance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323863-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7725520-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032524-6>

This prizewinning PhD thesis presents a general discussion of the orbital motion close to solar system small bodies (SSSBs), which induce non-central asymmetric gravitational fields in their neighborhoods. It introduces the methods of qualitative theory in nonlinear dynamics to the study of local/global behaviors around SSSBs. Detailed mechanical models are employed throughout this dissertation, and specific numeric techniques are developed to compensate for the difficulties of directly analyzing. Applying this method, several target systems, like asteroid 216 Kleopatra, are explored in great detail, and the results prove to be both revealing and pervasive for a large group of SSSBs. .	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072014-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177065-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174799-9>
Development of an Embedding Theory for the Calculation of Energetic Properties of Adsorbates on Metal Surfaces ¤ In this thesis a completely self consistent embedded cluster scheme has been developed. The theory allows the treatment of a cluster with ab initio methods (MP-n, CASSCF, CI) while a metallic environment is described via an embedding operator within Density Functional Theory (DFT). While previous applications within this theory used a partially self consistent embedding operator, in this work the derivation of a completely self consistent embedding scheme is presented. The theory is applied to the calculation of the adsorption energy of a CO molecule on a Pd(111) surface. The results are in very good agreement with experimental adsorption energies. The calculated binding energy of E=-1.63eV using the Moller-Plesset perturbation theory differs the experimental value by E=0.09eV.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145565-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164521-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151344-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141062-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174856-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246521-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141453-6>

Matching events and activities : preprocessing event logs for process analysis ¤ Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during process execution. Aiming at a better process understanding and improvement, this event data can be used to analyze processes using process mining techniques. Process models can be automatically discovered and the execution can be checked for conformance to specified behavior. Moreover, existing process models can be enhanced and annotated with valuable information, for example for performance analysis. While the maturity of process mining algorithms is increasing and more tools are entering the market, process mining projects still face the problem of different levels of abstraction when comparing events with modeled business activities. Mapping the recorded events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process discovery results.

Dynamic Heterogeneous Hydrogels with Cellulose Nanocrystals ¤ Most biological tissues are made out of hydrogels, which are three dimensionally (3D) crosslinked polymer chains in an aqueous microenvironment. Comparing with highly dynamic and heterogeneous natural hydrogels, such as muscle or cartilage, traditional synthetic hydrogels usually suffer from poor mechanical properties. Meanwhile, even the viscoelasticity of hydrogels is widely known, but it is lack of more sophisticated and more practical applications. In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and surface-modified CNC introduce heterogeneity into synthetic hydrogels. By mimicking the dynamic properties of natural hydrogels, such as muscles, the mechanical properties of synthetic hydrogels were improved. The results of this study show that the introduction of CNC into synthetic hydrogels leads to a significant improvement in mechanical properties. These results have important implications for the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties. Furthermore, it was shown that the surface modification of CNC plays a crucial role in controlling the heterogeneity in synthetic hydrogels. The results of this study have important implications for the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties and offer new perspectives for the application of hydrogels in various fields, such as medicine, biotechnology, and materials science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160909-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7574326-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147454-5>
Selective learning for recommender systems ¤ BEGIN... In this work we focus on the stream-based learning, since it has several advantages over the conventional, batch-based learning. One of the advantage is the ability to immediately incorporate new information into a preference model without relearning the entire model. This is an essential feature for real-life recommender systems, as their application scenarios are highly dynamic. Therefore, new information typically appears at a high rate. - Our first type are forgetting methods for stream-based recommender systems. Selecting what information to forget is equivalent to selecting which information to learn from. We propose eleven different forgetting strategies that select the obsolete information to be forgotten and three different algorithms that enforce forgetting on a stream of ratings. We stress that obsolete information is not necessarily old. Next to incorporating new information into a preference model, our forgetting techniques are the second way of adapting to concept drift or shift. - In our second type of selective learning we introduce selective neighbourhood for collaborative filtering methods. It encompasses a novel selection criterion based on the Hoeffding Bound for removing unreliable users from a neighbourhood. Our criterion considers both, the number of common ratings between users and the value of their similarity. - Our last selective approach is based on semi-supervised learning (SSL) for stream-based recommender systems. In this approach a recommender system exploits the abundant unlabelled information (user-item-pairs without ratings), which, typically, reaches 99% of all information. - To exploit this information for training of preference models we propose the first stream-based semi-supervised recommendation framework. In semi-supervised learning, predictions are used as labels. However, not all predictions are equally reliable. We propose components that selectively and incrementally estimate reliability of predictions and filter out the unreliable ones. Only highly reliable predictions are used for training in one of two SSL approaches: cotraining and self-learning. ... END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7511891-9>
Domino twofold Heck - 6π-electrocyclization and regioselective palladium(0)-catalyzed reactions of brominated indoles, furans, naphthoquinone and 2,4,5,6-tetrachloropyrimidine ¤ I have synthesized functionalized carbazoles and benzofurans based on domino twofold Heck / 6pi-electrocyclization reactions. Functionalized anthraquinones, fluorenones and benzocoumarines were also prepared by this methodology. Regioselctive Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of 2,4,5,6-tetrachloropyrimidine and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromofuran provided an expedient synthesis of mono-, di-, tri- and tetraaryl-pyrimidines and di- and tetraarylfurans.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4538754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151778-7>
Scanning near-field optical microscopy : from single-tip to dual-tip operation ¤ Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) is a powerful and widely-used method in nano- and micro-optics. In aperture SNOM, a dielectric tip with an opaque coating featuring a sub-wavelength aperture at the tip apex is used either to locally illuminate the sample under investigation, or to map the sample’s optical near-fields. In contrast to classical microscopy, SNOM provides access to the evanescent fields at the sample surface and is thus able to break the diffraction limit. In this thesis, several new near-field characterization methods were developed: By combining two SNOMs with fiber tips into a Dual-SNOM setup, samples can be near-field illuminated at a freely chosen position by the first tip, while the second tip scans the sample surface and maps the optical near-fields, thus giving access to the near-field Green’s function. The Dual-SNOM was used for polarization-selective mapping of plasmonic aperture emission and for the investigation of plasmonic modes in metal strip waveguides. Furthermore, two single-tip techniques were developed and were applied to map whispering-gallery modes (WGM) in fused silica microdisk resonators. In scanning thermocouple-probe microscopy, the sample surface is scanned by a miniature thermocouple tip, which is heated by optical absorption and thus converts the optical signal into an electrical signal directly at the measurement location. In the second mapping method for WGM, a sharp, fully metal-coated fiber tip is used as a scatterer whose position influences the resonance positions and the coupling between WGMs and their respective counter-propagating, degenerate modes. Consequently, the transmission and reflection that can be measured at the ends of the tapered fiber loop which serves for excitation of the WGMs are also modified by the tip’s presence. By correlating the transmission and reflection signals with the tip’s position, highly resolved images were obtained. As an application example of aperture SNOM, near-field mapping of non-broadening plasmonic Airy beams and of plasmonic hot-spots generated by interference of two such beams is demonstrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174845-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4380320-9>
Improved rapid assessment of earthquake hazard safety of existing buildings using a hierarchical Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Model ¤ Although it is impractical to avert subsequent natural disasters, advances in simulation science and seismological studies make it possible to lessen the catastrophic damage. There currently exists in many urban areas a large number of structures, which are prone to damage by earthquakes. These were constructed without the guidance of a national seismic code, either before it existed or before it was enforced. For instance, in Istanbul, Turkey, as a high seismic area, around 90% of buildings are substandard, which can be generalized into other earthquake-prone regions in Turkey. The reliability of this building stock resulting from earthquake-induced collapse is currently uncertain. Nonetheless, it is also not feasible to perform a detailed seismic vulnerability analysis on each building as a solution to the scenario, as it will be too complicated and expensive. This indicates the necessity of a reliable, rapid, and computationally easy method for seismic vulnerability assessment, commonly known as Rapid Visual Screening (RVS). In RVS methodology, an observational survey of buildings is performed, and according to the data collected during the visual inspection, a structural score is calculated without performing any structural calculations to determine the expected damage of a building and whether the building needs detailed assessment. Although this method might save time and resources due to the subjective/qualitative judgments of experts who performed the inspection, the evaluation process is dominated by vagueness and uncertainties, where the vagueness can be handled adequately through the fuzzy set theory but do not cover all sort of uncertainties due to its crisp membership functions. In this study, a novel method of rapid visual hazard safety assessment of buildings against earthquake is introduced in which an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) is used to cover uncertainties. In addition, the proposed method provides the possibility to evaluate the earthquake risk of the building by considering factors related to the building importance and exposure. A smartphone app prototype of the method has been introduced. For validation of the proposed method, two case studies have been selected, and the result of the analysis presents the robust efficiency of the proposed method.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113456-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341284-1>
Convex Integration Applied to the Multi-Dimensional Compressible Euler Equations ¤ This book applies the convex integration method to multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations in the barotropic case as well as the full system with temperature. The convex integration technique, originally developed in the context of differential inclusions, was applied in the groundbreaking work of De Lellis and Székelyhidi to the incompressible Euler equations, leading to infinitely many solutions. This theory was later refined to prove non-uniqueness of solutions of the compressible Euler system, too. These non-uniqueness results all use an ansatz which reduces the equations to a kind of incompressible system to which a slight modification of the incompressible theory can be applied. This book presents, for the first time, a generalization of the De Lellis–Székelyhidi approach to the setting of compressible Euler equations. The structure of this book is as follows: after providing an accessible introduction to the subject, including the essentials of hyperbolic conservation laws, the idea of convex integration in the compressible framework is developed. The main result proves that under a certain assumption there exist infinitely many solutions to an abstract initial boundary value problem for the Euler system. Next some applications of this theorem are discussed, in particular concerning the Riemann problem. Finally there is a survey of some related results. This self-contained book is suitable for both beginners in the field of hyperbolic conservation laws as well as for advanced readers who already know about convex integration in the incompressible framework.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219070-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019339-1>

Magnetothermal Properties near Quantum Criticality in the Itinerant Metamagnet Sr3Ru2O7 ¤ The compound Sr3Ru2O7 of the strontium ruthenate family has been intensely studied because experimental evidence suggests that quantum fluctuations dominate the magnetic phase diagram in the vicinity of a novel low-temperature phase. In order to understand the interplay between the quantum critical fluctuations and the phase formation, comprehensive thermodynamic information is essential. This thesis reports the results of both specific-heat and magnetocaloric experiments carried out with a bespoke experimental apparatus whose design particularly addresses the demanding constraints of the low-temperature, high-magnetic-field environment. The experimental data give evidence for unusual thermodynamic properties of the novel phase and its bounding phase transitions. Furthermore they show that the phase formation takes place against a background of strongly peaking entropy, suggesting that quantum criticality plays a key role in the physics of this system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133961-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169643-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254966-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4507896-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168593-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4793582-0>

Variational Source Conditions, Quadratic Inverse Problems, Sparsity Promoting Regularization : New Results in Modern Theory of Inverse Problems and an Application in Laser Optics ¤ The book collects and contributes new results on the theory and practice of ill-posed inverse problems. Different notions of ill-posedness in Banach spaces for linear and nonlinear inverse problems are discussed not only in standard settings but also in situations up to now not covered by the literature. Especially, ill-posedness of linear operators with uncomplemented null spaces is examined. Tools for convergence rate analysis of regularization methods are extended to a wider field of applicability. It is shown that the tool known as variational source condition always yields convergence rate results. A theory for nonlinear inverse problems with quadratic structure is developed as well as corresponding regularization methods. The new methods are applied to a difficult inverse problem from laser optics. Sparsity promoting regularization is examined in detail from a Banach space point of view. Extensive convergence analysis reveals new insights into the behavior of Tikhonov-type regularization with sparsity enforcing penalty Inverse problems, ill-posedness, regularization -- Variational source conditions yield convergence rates -- Existence of variational source conditions -- What are quadratic inverse problems? -- Tikhonov regularization -- Regularization by decomposition -- Variational source conditions -- Aren’t all questions answered? -- Sparsity and 1-regularization -- Ill-posedness in the l1-setting -- Convergence rates	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186951-5>
Semi-automatic optimization of hardware architectures in embedded systems ¤ In this work a semi-automatic approach for the optimization of hardware architectures of safety-critical embedded systems is presented that supports developers in extending already existing systems with additional functionality given as software tasks. A two-tier optimization process explores the design space for valid allocations of the software tasks to the hardware architecture. The method exploits that large embedded systems typically are hierarchically composed of hardware subsystems: A global optimization step computes pre-allocations of all software tasks onto subsystems based on an abstract notion of the computation capacity. Separately for each subsystem, those tasks are then allocated to processors by local optimization steps such that they are schedulable and all constraints are satisfied. For both the global and the local optimization problem exact optimization methods bundled with experimental results are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043664-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179449-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131397-5>

Synthesis of New Diaminoterephthalic Acid Derivatives ¤ In this dissertation different 2,5-diaminoterephthalate derivatives with fluorescent abilities, among others one dimer and compounds with up to four connecting positions for other reactions were synthesized. Furthermore, the pH-dependence and the improvement of synthesis’ efficiency were investigated. By introducing one or two maleimide moieties to the diaminoterephthalates, the labeling of the protein recoverin was possible. The maleimide compounds show no fluorescence, but after conjugated addition fluorescence turns on. This process was explained by calculations of the theoretical chemistry. Another topic is the synthesis of 2,3-diaminoterephthalates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4320674-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076388-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154827-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4317852-2>
Dynamics and underlying processes of N2O and NO soil-atmosphere exchange under extreme meteorological boundary conditions ¤ Climate models predict an increasing frequency and intensity of summer drought periods with subsequent heavy rainfall or soil frost and thaw events in mountain regions of Central Europe. These indirect effects of global warming may considerably influence soil microbial processes and in consequence emissions of climate-relevant trace gases. Regarding the nitrogen cycle, N2O and NO emissions are of concern, since they are involved in climate warming and soils represent a main source for these two gases. In spite of a growing number of studies on this subject, knowledge on effects of climate change on soil N2O and NO emissions is still scarce. This is mainly due to a hitherto poor mechanistic understanding of underlying processes within soil. In this thesis, the impact of extreme meteorological boundary conditions on N2O and NO fluxes in a Norway spruce forest and an acidic fen in the Fichtelgebirge area was investigated. The summer drought period and precipitation were experimentally increased in the forest and the fen over a 2-year span. Soil frost was induced in the forest by removal of the natural snow cover. The experiments were run in three replicates each and non-manipulated plots served as controls. Throughout the experiments, N2O and NO fluxes were recorded in weekly to monthly intervals. In addition, N2O concentrations and isotope signatures in soil air were measured along soil profiles to identify and localise the underlying biogenic production and consumption processes. Prolonged drought continuously reduced the N2O emission from the forest soil and even turned the soil temporarily into a sink for atmospheric N2O. Soil freezing and thawing caused a burst of N2O release contributing 84 % of the annual emission ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146122-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183276-0>
Novel luminescent crystalline materials of gold(I) complexes with stimuli-responsive properties ¤ This book highlights and investigates novel solid-state luminescent properties of crystals with stimuli-responsive behavior. Several novel molecular designs for controlling crystal structures with photo-physical properties are described, with a special focus on external stimuli-responsive properties. The major goal of the material design concept was to capitalize on the chirality of crystals with stimuli-responsive properties. To allow crystals’ chirality to be controlled and modified by means of external stimulation, the axial chirality of biaryl moiety was employed and, interestingly, produced several novel mechano- and vapo-responsive luminescent properties based on crystal-to-crystal or single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transitions. In addition, the book details how the molecular rotation of luminophores in the solid phase can be used to achieve corresponding thermal-responsive phosphorescence. The reports presented here illustrate how the author has succeeded in controlling structural factors in a bulk environment by using molecular design with linking to photo-physical properties. The content will be of great interest to researchers in the field, and to members of chemical and material science societies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274825-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172680-7>
Influence of the variability in pulp quality on the alkalization processes ¤ A comprehensive description and comparison of present market dissolving wood pulps (DWP) is provided. The systematic difference between kraft and sulfite pulps destined for the same application could be shown. Alkalization or alkaline extraction is the most common process operation when using DWP. A method to determine the degree of conversion to alkali cellulose as a result of alkalization based on Raman spectroscopy was developed. Extraction with 18 wt% aq. NaOH gave for all DWP investigated optimal alkalization results regarding yield, purity, and transformation. The choice of steeping temperature was found to be important in order to balance yield and purity of xylan-containing pulps. DWP is usually dried prior to application. Never-dried pulp is supposed to have a better processability due to less hornification. The structural changes induced by drying performed with differing severity as it might occur due to variations in the drying machine were investigated. The determination of the water retention value gave the most consistent results. Evaluations using solid-state NMR and size exclusion chromatography could support the findings. An application study when carboxymethylating alkalized paper and dissolving wood pulp with extreme variation in hemicellulose content, intrinsic viscosity, content of extractives and content of cellulose II found that favorable process conditions using 15 wt% aq. NaOH turn all pulps used into well soluble carboxymethylated cellulose (CMC) with a high degree of substitution (DS). A DS near to the limit for water solubility was obtained when CMC was prepared in the presence of 5 wt% aq. NaOH and gave the possibility to rank different pulps in terms of their solubility. None of the various measured chemical and supramolecular properties could clearly explain the differences between the used DWP which suggests further investigations on the reason for the different applicability of pulps.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067554-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278888-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4392676-9>
Electro-acoustical probing of space-charge and dipole-polarization profiles in polymer dielectrics for electret and electrical-insulation applications ¤ Electrets are dielectrics with quasi-permanent electric charge and/or dipoles, sometimes can be regarded as an electric analogy to a magnet. Since the discovery of the excellent charge retention capacity of poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) and the invention of the electret microphone, electrets have grown out of a scientific curiosity to an important application both in science and technology. The history of electret research goes hand in hand with the quest for new materials with better capacity at charge and/or dipole retention. To be useful, electrets normally have to be charged/poled to render them electro-active. This process involves electric-charge deposition and/or electric dipole orientation within the dielectrics ` surfaces and bulk. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of electric charge and/or dipole polarization after their deposition and subsequent decay is crucial in the task to improve their stability in the dielectrics. Likewise, for dielectrics used in electrical insulation applications, there are also needs for ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4755797-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151716-7>

Population genetic models with selection, fluctuating environments and population structure$nvorgelegt von Elisabeth Sester-Huss ¤ BEGIN Abstract: This thesis consists of three parts each dealing with different questions related to population genetics. We start with the study of the effect of natural selection on genealogies. We make use of the theory on tree-valued Fleming-Viot processes that describe the evolution of genealogical trees to compute the Laplace-transform of the tree length both in the neutral and in the selective setting. We show that trees are shorter in the selective case (under the so-called Laplace-transform-order) than trees under neutrality - an assumption already widely believed to be true in the field of biology.<br>In the second part we work with a mutation-selection model in a fluctuating environment by introducing a modifier locus determining the mutation rate at a second locus. Fitness acts on the second locus and changes as the environment fluctuates. For a fast fluctutating environment, we obtain limit results for the evolution of allele frequencies and apply them to a two-type setting in which we compute the fixation probability for the higher mutation rate.<br>The last part focuses on analysing human DNA samples and estimating their heritage. The aim is to extend the already existing models for inferring individual admixture proportions - a vector of which each entry corresponds to the fraction of one's genome originating from a certain population. We develop a method that delivers individual admixture proportions of an individual's parents. This enables us to test whether the admixture of two populations has occured only recently or several generations ago. We apply both the already existing method and our new method to the 1000 genomes dataset and test the accuracy of their outputs by computing the distance to their true admixture proportions END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046804-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057630-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121729-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020097-8>
Modeling the free energy landscape of biomolecules : small RNAs and peptide aggregation ¤ Abstract: The free energy landscape is a key quantity to represent and understand biomolecular processes like folding, molecular recognition and aggregation. While most experiments reveal structural properties of biomolecules, theoretical methods like molecular dynamics simulations additionally generate dynamical information at the microscopic level. Thanks to the development of optimized algorithms together with an increase in computational power, complex biomolecular processes can be directly simulated up to a time scale of microseconds. The studies in this thesis were motivated by a lack of proper methods to construct the free energy landscape for a specific class of molecules, that is, nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, and for a particular process, peptide aggregation. To study the energy landscape of nucleic acids, first various kinds of collective variables are introduced. Internal coordinates are shown to give a better resolution of the energy landscape while keeping information about the intramolecular structure of the molecule. As an intriguing example, the analysis strategy is applied to the binding mechanism and specificity of a RNA riboswitch, i.e., a small molecule that can trigger gene expression. Finally, the focus is on peptide aggregation, a molecular mechanism of biomedical interest due to the relation between amyloid formation and degenerative diseases. Applied to several model systems, the new theoretical approaches and developments are shown to lead to a better microscopic understanding of complex biomolecular processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076759-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076388-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170370-4>

Comprehensive knowledge base extraction for learning agents : practical challenges and applications in games ¤ The need for artificial intelligence systems that are not only capable of mastering complicated tasks but also of explaining their decisions has massively gained attention over the last years. This also seems to offer opportunities for further interconnecting different approaches to artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and knowledge representation. This work considers the task of learning knowledge bases from agent behavior, with a focus on human-readability, comprehensibility and applications in games. In this context, it will be presented how knowledge can be organized and processed on multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for efficient reasoning and revision. It will be investigated how learning agents can benefit from incorporating the approaches into their learning processes. Examples and applications are provided, e.g., in the context of general video game playing. The most essential approaches are implemented in the InteKRator toolbox and show potential for being applied in other domains (e.g., in medical informatics)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049534-6>
Spectroscopic evidence for clusters of like-charged ions in ionic liquids ¤ In this work the counterintuitive phenomenon of attraction between ions of like charge is described for ionic liquids. It is based on cooperative hydrogen bonding leading to different sized cationic clusters. Experimentally these clusters are indicated by characteristic spectroscopic features like e.g. redshifts of OH vibrational frequencies. The experimental observables can be related to charge transfer and second order stabilization energy. Finally, a theoretical approach of stabilizing the cationic cluster network by either neutral molecules or negatively charged counterions has been done.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064787-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4576774-9>
Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for the identification of aminopyrene trisulfonic acid labeled glycans ¤ The aim of this work was the development of capillary-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (CE-MS) methods with high separation power for the characterization of aminopyrene-trisulfonic acid (APTS)-labeled glycans. State of the art for routine glycan analysis is capillary sieving electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (CSE-LIF) using the fluorescent APTS. However, a firsthand identification of glycans is not possible. This thesis presents two high performance CE-MS methods, with appropriate separation efficiency (i.e. resolution of structural isomers) for biopharmaceutical samples. The first method uses a novel alkaline background electrolyte (BGE) for the simultaneous analysis of APTS-labeled as well as charged native glycans. The alkaline BGE enables a robust CE-MS application and the determination of derivatization and ionization efficiency. The glycans of several different types of biopharmaceutically relevant proteins could be identified. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072712-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290002-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037882-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4739536-9>
Transcriptome dynamics to unravel PC12 cell fate decisions ¤ Abstract: The PC12 cell line is a well-established cell model system for analysing cell fate decision-making processes. When stimulated with the growth factor EGF the cells proliferate increasingly, when stimulated with the nerve growth factor NGF the cells differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons. Both processes are regulated via the ERK/MAPK pathway. In this context, signal duration of activated ERK seems to be the key mechanism for the emergence of the distinct cell fates. Whereas NGF stimulation results in sustained ERK activation and neuronal differentiation of the cell line, EGF stimulation activates ERK transiently and results in enhanced cell proliferation. How the temporal dynamics of ERK signalling are encoded and translated in order to specify cell fates has not been fully understood yet. <br>This thesis is the first comparison of the EGF and NGF induced transcriptome of PC12 cells on a time scale of 24 hours with high sample density. It was shown that the EGF and NGF stimulus activate a very similar set of genes, which initiates and modulates the cell fate decision. These genes’ expression dynamics, however, were different depending on the stimulus used: EGF stimulation induced a short impulse-like gene expression pattern, whereas NGF stimulation resulted in a long-sustained response. In line with previous studies it was demonstrated, that immediate early genes such as Egr1, Fos and Junb show an increased stability in the case of NGF stimulation. It was shown, that this is most likely due to a delayed negative transcriptional feedback via Fosl1, Atf3, Maff, Klf2 und Zfp36l2. Moreover it was demonstrated, that both cell fates, proliferation as well as differentiation, are not solely dependent on the ERK/MAPK pathway. Within the first hour after stimulation with EGF cross-talk between the MAPK and PI3K pathways seems necessary in order to induce enhanced cell proliferation. After stimulation with NGF a more complex and sequential activation of different pathways was identified. In this context the activation of the Il6 pathway and the uPA/uPAR complex seems to be of special importance. The activation of these two pathways was exclusively seen after NGF-stimulation, which encourages further research to gain a deeper understanding of their function in the process of neuronal differentiation. Additionally, Dusp6 was identified as a potentially important modulator of the PC12 cell fate.

Organic redox-active materials for redox-flow batteries ¤ Redox-flow batteries (RFBs) are eminently suitable for the storage of wind and solar energy since their capacity and power capability are independently scalable. Furthermore, RFBs can be precisely adapted to the generator unit. However, common metal-based RFBs utilize toxic and high-price metal salts, hazardous and corrosive acidic electrolytes, and expensive ion-exchange membranes. By the use of redox-active organic molecules and polymers, whose solubility and electrochemical properties can be adjusted, as active materials, these limitations can be overcome. In this thesis, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of redox-active small molecules as well as polymer-based organic active materials for the usage in RFBs are studied. In this context, all-organic symmetric redox-flow batteries and zinc-organic hybrid-flow batteries are described. Moreover, an all-organic combined RFB, which uses a polymer and a small-molecule compound as charge-storage materials, is developed and the key factors in terms of its battery performance are investigated in detail.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076577-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480266-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152230-8>
In vitro tests for the characterization of magnesium as resorbable implant material ¤ Magnesium is highly suitable as future material for resorbable implants.

Mineralogical and chemical characterization of airborne dust particles and their environmental effects in the open-pit coal mining area in Quang Ninh, NE Vietnam ¤ BEGIN Abstract: Vast reserves of anthracite coal have been detected in the Quang Ninh province in the northeastern region of Vietnam (reserves~6.3 Gt). Cam Pha, located in the Quang Ninh province, is one of the largest anthracite coal mining areas. Coal mining activities are a source of atmospheric pollution and are also detrimental to water quality. These factors are a hazard to human health. <br>This study is aimed at characterizing the forms of environmental pollution derived from coal mining activities and mine waste. Mining leads to environmental damage through airborne dust, acid mine drainage and chemical weathering of waste rock. One aim of this study was to identify the source of airborne dust in this area and its chemical and physical properties were characterized, as well as its effects on human health, focusing on identifying the source of the coal miners’ occupational diseases. A second aim was to determine the effects of acid mine drainage on water quality near the largest coal mine in the area. In order to achieve these goals, field samples including: airborne particles, coal and waste rock, material in overburden piles, mine tailings, dumps, water samples and the lung lavage samples were collected. The mineral composition of solid samples was determined by using a variety of complementary microscopic and bulk analysis techniques (e.g. EMPA, XRD, SEM/EDS, F-AAS, GF-AAS, ICP-MS). The results showed that dust, lung lavages and waste rock were composed of the same mineral components, such as: quartz, kaolinite, illite and muscovite. Furthermore, the bulk chemical composition of airborne particles were investigated which were then compared to the composition of other solid samples (e.g. waste rock, coal). To establish a link between airborne dust particles and these materials, it is of utmost importance to understand the geological features of coal mining area. Finally, a relationship between trace metal concentrations in solid samples (e.g waste rock, coal, airborne dust), the rice paddy soils in Cam Pha and the lung lavages from miners were found in the Cam Pha mining area END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057011-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4513441-8>

Silicon thin film concepts for building integrated photovoltaic applications ¤ The growing market of building integrated photovoltaic applications and projects increases the demand for versatile and novel photovoltaic modules. Thin-film silicon solar cells have a significant advantage over other photovoltaic module types because of their high flexibility. Silicon absorber material can be enhanced by adding germanium. Using the advantages of a band-gap reduced by the addition of germanium enables the absorption of light with a longer wavelength. The µc-Si1-XGeX:H absorbers investigated show the same efficiency as the µc-Si:H absorbers but with reduced thickness. Simulations of different planes of orientation and tilt that were simulated in terms of irradiance for bifacial modules. Results show that, even for Oldenburg, vertically installed modules with high bifaciality can receive more irradiance than monofacial modules with optimum tilt and orientation. A bifaciality of over 95 % can be achieved for single junction cells by redesigning the n-layer for high energy light transparency. The result is a semi-transparent bifacial solar module which meets the demands of many building integrated photovoltaic applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121476-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1135163685> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150833-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135644-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1073326764>
Pluvial flood loss to private households ¤ Today, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. With a high density of population and assets, urban areas are not only the economic, cultural and social hubs of every society, they are also highly susceptible to natural disasters. As a consequence of rising sea levels and an expected increase in extreme weather events caused by a changing climate in combination with growing cities, flooding is an increasing threat to many urban agglomerations around the globe.To mitigate the destructive consequences of flooding, appropriate risk management and adaptation strategies are required. So far, flood risk management in urban areas is almost exclusively focused on managing river and coastal flooding. Often overlooked is the risk from small-scale rainfall-triggered flooding, where the rainfall intensity of rainstorms exceeds the capacity of urban drainage systems, leading to immediate flooding. Referred to as pluvial flooding, this flood type exclusive to urban areas has caused severe losses in cities around the world.

The Deployment of the Bundeswehr Abroad 1990–2015: A Discourse-Linguistic Investigation Based on Argumentations ¤ This volume examines discussions surrounding the legitimacy of the Bundeswehr’s deployments abroad by looking at 2,773 newspaper texts. The study analyzes the use and mentions of prototypical arguments and characterizes their discursive actors. It sketches the trajectory taken by discourse between 1990 and 2015, describing both socially accepted and contentious knowledge in a subject area that has mostly been overlooked by linguistics so far. Based on a corpus (2,773 texts from taz, FR, SZ, FAZ, Welt), this discourse-linguistic study examines the discussion surrounding the legitimacy of the Bundeswehr’s deployments abroad. It identifies relevant arguments, quantifies their use and mention, characterizes discursive actors based on their arguments, and sketches the trajectory of the discourse. This historically explanatory and understanding, inductive and heuristic approach to argumentation analysis sees this as a crucial access point to describing cognitive, affective, and volitive dispositions of a societal collectivity, in the tradition of the Düsseldorf School. By identifying prototypical arguments, it simultaneously takes into account the argumentative inventory, the essential actors, and continuities and breaks in the use and mention of arguments and the appearance of these actors. On the theoretical basis of constructivist language use research, descriptive statements are made about socially accepted and contentious knowledge in the period from 1990 to 2015 in a discourse-linguistic area that has been largely unexplored so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114599-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068999-2>
The Storm-God and the Sea : The Origin, Versions, and Diffusion of a Myth throughout the Ancient Near East ¤ The tale of the combat between the Storm-god and the Sea that began circulating in the early second millennium BCE was one of the most well-known ancient Near Eastern myths. Its widespread dissemination in distinct versions across disparate locations and time periods – Syria, Egypt, Anatolia, Ugarit, Mesopotamia, and Israel – calls for analysis of all the textual variants in order to determine its earliest form, geo-cultural origin, and transmission history. In undertaking this task, Noga Ayali-Darshan examines works such as the Astarte Papyrus, the Pišaiša Myth, the Songs of Hedammu and Ullikummi, the Baal Cycle, Enūma eliš, and pertinent biblical texts. She interprets these and other related writings philologically according to their provenance and comparatively in the light of parallel texts. The examination of this story appearing in all the ancient Near Eastern cultures also calls for a discussion of the theology, literature, and history of these societies and the way they shaped the local versions of the myth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128644-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041005-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038301-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169235-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163168-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4231163-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141969-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4747698-9>
Operators on singular manifolds ¤ We study the interplay between analysis on manifolds with singularities and complex analysis and develop new structures of operators based on the Mellin transform and tools for iterating the calculus for higher singularities. We refer to the idea of interpreting boundary value problems (BVPs) in terms of pseudo-differential operators with a principal symbolic hierarchy, taking into account that BVPs are a source of cone and edge operator algebras. The respective cone and edge pseudo-differential algebras in turn are the starting point of higher corner theories. In addition there are deep relationships between corner operators and complex analysis. This will be illustrated by the Mellin symbolic calculus.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047640-6>
Exhaustion in Digital Work Distribution via Cloud Computing: An Examination of the Scope of the UsedSoft Judgment of the ECJ ¤ The consumption of copyright protected works has already become a part of everyday life. Books and music can legally be downloaded and saved on several devices. Movies are mainly distributed via cloud computing and retrieved via streaming technologies. These new channels of distribution create numerous advantages for copyright owners and consumers. However, adapting the copyright law to these new technologies creates obstacles. A cornerstone of the copyright law - the principle of exhaustion of intellectual property rights - is statutorily only applicable to the distribution of material copies of a piece of work. However, the European Court of Justice has affirmed the exhaustion of copyright when software is downloaded. This work finds answers to the question of whether the principle of exhaustion of intellectual property rights can be transferred to the distribution of other forms of digital work, especially via cloud computing, in order to ensure a fair balance between the interests of copyright owners and consumers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062127-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331649-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127117-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202369-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4614855-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130885-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4592128-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4675352-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>
Transpiration by oil palm and rubber plantations: refining methods and delineating differences ¤ Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Müll.

An analytical and numerical analysis of fluid-filled crack propagation in three dimensions ¤ Fluids in the Earth's crust can move by creating and flowing through fractures, in a process called `hydraulic fracturing’. The tip-line of such fluid-filled fractures grows at locations where stress is larger than the strength of the rock. Where the tip stress vanishes, the fracture closes and the fluid-front retreats. If stress gradients exist on the fracture's walls, induced by fluid/rock density contrasts or topographic stresses, this results in an asymmetric shape and growth of the fracture, allowing for the contained batch of fluid to propagate through the crust. The state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods to simulate fluid-filled fracture propagation are two-dimensional (2D). In this work I extend these to three dimensions (3D). In my analytical method, I approximate the propagating 3D fracture as a penny-shaped crack that is influenced by both an internal pressure and stress gradients. In addition, I develop a numerical method to model propagation where curved fractures can be simulated as a mesh of triangular elements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126280-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050134-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076508-8>
Numerical simulation of thermo-chemo-hygro-mechanical alkali-silica reaction model in concrete at the mesoscale and macroscale ¤ Alkali-silica reaction causes major problems in concrete structures due to the rapidity of its deformation which leads to the serviceability limit of the structure being reached well before its time. Factors that affect ASR vary greatly, including alkali and silica content, relative humidity, temperature and porosity of the cementitious matrix,all these making it a very complex phenomenon to consider explicitly. With this in mind, the finite element technique was used to build models and generate expansive pressures and damage propagation due to ASR under the influence of thermo-hygrochemoelastic loading. Since ASR initializes in the mesoscopic regions of the concrete, the accumulative effects of its expansion escalates onto the macroscale level with the development of web cracking on the concrete surface, hence solution of the damage model as well as simulation of the ASR phenomenon at both the macroscale and mesoscale levels have been performed. The macroscale model realizes the effects of ASR expansion as a whole and shows how it develops under the influence of moisture, thermal and mechanical loading. Results of the macroscale modeling are smeared throughout the structure and are sufficient to show how damage due to ASR expansion orientates. As opposed to the mesoscale model, the heterogeneity of the model shows us how difference in material properties between aggregates and the cementitious matrix facilitates ASR expansion. With both these models, the ASR phenomenon under influence of thermo-chemo-hygro-mechanical loading can be better understood.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126904-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7684670-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196812-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7651795-0>
Understanding comparative questions and retrieving argumentative answers ¤ Making decisions is an integral part of everyday life, yet it can be a difficult and complex process. While peoples’ wants and needs are unlimited, resources are often scarce, making it necessary to research the possible alternatives and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. Nowadays, the Internet has become the main source of information when it comes to comparing alternatives, making search engines the primary means for collecting new information. However, relying only on term matching is not sufficient to adequately address requests for comparisons. Therefore, search systems should go beyond this approach to effectively address comparative information needs. In this dissertation, I explore from different perspectives how search systems can respond to comparative questions. First, I examine approaches to identifying comparative questions and study their underlying information needs. Second, I investigate a methodology to identify important constituents of comparative questions like the to-be-compared options and to detect the stance of answers towards these comparison options. Then, I address ambiguous comparative search queries by studying an interactive clarification search interface. And finally, addressing answering comparative questions, I investigate retrieval approaches that consider not only the topical relevance of potential answers but also account for the presence of arguments towards the comparison options mentioned in the questions. By addressing these facets, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively satisfy the information needs of searchers seeking to compare different alternatives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134011-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026899-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018041-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273545-2>

Towards product diversification in carbon negative bioprocesses with Clostridium ljungdahlii ¤ The way to sustainable chemical production will require carbon capture technologies that allow abundant and cheap carbon dioxide to be available, to be used in carbon fixation processes. Among the non-photosynthetic biological carbon fixation processes, the ones catalyzed by acetogenic bacteria such as gas fermentation and microbial electrosynthesis stand out. Both processes are limited in terms of the range of products they can offer, and although gas fermentation has already reached the industrial scale, microbial electrosynthesis is a process with great potential but still new and not yet developed. The deepening of our knowledge about the metabolism of acetogenic bacteria such as Clostridium ljungdahlii, as well as the development of molecular tools, is crucial for the expansion of the portfolio of products that acetogens can offer. In this thesis, the mode of extracellular electron transfer and the role of hydrogen in microbial electrosynthesis with C. ljungdahlii is unveiled, leading to highly productive planktonic systems that decouple activity from biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is proposed that two putative glycine-based carbon fixation pathways are activated under redox stress conditions, leading to the production in significant quantities of metabolites that are rarely found in microbial electrosynthesis or gas fermentation. The in-situ formation of electrocatalysts promotes the formation of formate on carbon-based cathodes, likely boosting C. ljungdahlii growth, and it represents a promising finding for the future development of catalytic cathodes. The development of molecular tools allowed to establish in C. ljungdahlii an anaerobic fluorescent marker, CRISPR/Cas systems for the generation of deletions, and a heterologous expression system to produce ethyl acetate from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. All these advances will be used synergistically in the future to further expand the product range and improve the selectivity for target metabolites.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353981-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148085-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151767-2>

Geometrical methods for kinematics and dynamics in relativistic theories of gravity with applications to cosmology and space physics ¤ The main goal of this work is to estimate the effect of the global cosmological expansion of the Universe on the dynamics of local systems and on measurements. Examples are the motion of planets and spacecrafts and their Doppler tracking. For this purpose we first develop a general framework for relativistic kinematics and dynamics within which these problems can be precisely formulated and solved.

Proteins of the Factor H protein family bind to C-reactive protein and regulate complement activity on apoptotic and necrotic host cells ¤ The complement system protects the host against foreign organisms and induces a non-inflammatory phagocytosis of damaged or mutated host cells. Complement regulators protect intact host cells against complement attack and prevent inflammatory reactions. Factor H is the main soluble regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Factor H binds to host cells and blocks the alternative complement activation to prevent cell- and tissue damages. In addition, Factor H binds the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP opsonizes apoptotic and necrotic host cells and microbial invaders for phagocytosis by activating the classical complement cascade. However, the amplification loop via the alternative pathway and the pro-inflammatory terminal complement pathway are inhibited. Here I analyzed the role of Factor H binding to CRP in this limitation of complement. Furthermore, the Factor H related (CFHR) proteins CFHR-1, CFHR-4A, and CFHR-4B, which have a high similarity to Factor H, were functionally characterized. In this work I show, that Factor H, CFHR 4A, and CFHR-4B bind different isoforms of CRP. Factor H binds monomeric CRP (mCRP), while CFHR-4A/4B bind pentameric CRP (pCRP). Moreover, the analyzed proteins of the Factor H protein family regulate complement at the surface of cellular debris. Factor H and CFHR 1 inhibit complement and protect cellular debris from inflammatory complement attack, while CFHR 4A/4B enhance the cell opsonization through recruitment of pCRP.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049075-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120589-3>

Experimental and theoretical analysis of closed-flow column experiments : an alternative approach for the investigation of solute transport on the continuum scale ¤ Research of solute transport fundamentally contributes to our understanding of soil functions as most processes in soils are dynamically driven and related to the transient conditions produced by the transport of solutes. For this reason, especially the transport of contaminants is frequently studied with laboratory scale column outflow experiments in an open-flow mode. This thesis presents a complementary approach of conducting saturated column experiments that is characterized by the recirculation of the effluent into the inflow via a mixing vessel and is therefore referred to as closed-flow mode column experiment. Depending on the ratio of the volume of the mixing vessel and the water-filled pore space, a damped oscillating concentration emerges in the effluent and in the mixing vessel. Oscillation frequency, damping and amplitude are thereby governed by the properties of the porous medium and the target substance. It was shown by column experiments with quartz sand that the appearance of oscillations can be controlled by using different mixing vessel solute volumes. The breakthrough data obtained within these experiments was then used to validate a numerical model that was derived by coupling the numerical solution of a transport equation with the model describing the mixing vessel in a loop. This model was used for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to illustrate the response of the breakthrough curve to changes in the dispersion and the parameters describing adsorption with respect to strength, rate and nonlinearity. Each process thereby produced unique responses that confirm the high information content of closed-flow breakthrough data, which has shown to intrinsically contain information on the water content and the pumping rate as well. Finally, a numerical analysis of inverse parameter determination revealed a massive decrease in parameter uncertainty under optimal conditions, which renders the approach also highly relevant for practical applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156462-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4432839-4>

Learning Outcomes in Higher Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and Limits of a Learner-Oriented Approach in University Teaching ¤ The importance of learning outcomes in higher education is constantly increasing. But at Germany’s higher educational institutions, there still is a remarkable lack of proper implementation concerning the “Shift from Teaching to Learning”. The dissertation analyses the term and concept of learning outcomes within politics of higher education. It points out how the constructions of employability and citizenship are linked to learning outcomes. It is also being analysed how instructional design in higher education can be further developed in connection to the aspect of learning outcomes. Likewise, it has been achieved to point out systematically the discussion about learning outcomes from a higher education policy perspective as well as from an instructional design perspective. At last, the dissertation explores the perspective of practicians concerning their view on coherent, outcome-oriented higher education. This exploration will lead to lines of development as well as to practical recommendations for outcome-oriented higher education. In addition, this should pave the way for quality development at German HEIs under the aspect of learning outcomes. The concept of learning outcomes is increasingly gaining importance in the wake of higher education policy developments. However, the implementation of the “Shift from Teaching to Learning” at German universities is still pending. The dissertation first examines the term and concept of learning outcomes in the current higher education policy context and shows how the competence constructs employability and citizenship are linked to learning outcomes. Subsequently, it is investigated how higher education concepts can be further developed under the aspect of outcome orientation. In this way, it has been possible to systematically demonstrate the discussion on outcome orientation from a higher education policy and a higher education didactic perspective for the first time. Finally, the question is addressed from the perspective of practitioners how a coherent outcome orientation of study modules can be achieved. In this context, development lines and action recommendations for outcome-oriented higher education are shown, which pave the way for quality development at universities under this specific aspect.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160198-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4833805-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4385295-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035408-8>
Thermospheric density and wind determination from satellite dynamics ¤ The Earth's atmosphere is often portrayed as a thin and finite blanket covering our planet, separate from the emptiness of outer space. In reality, the transition is gradual and a tiny fraction of the atmophere gases is still present at the altitude of low orbiting satellites. The very high velocities of these satellites ensure that their orbital motion can still be considerably affected by air density and wind. This influence can be measured using accelerometers and satellite tracking techniques. The opening chapters of this thesis provide an excellent introduction to the various disciplines that are involved in the interpretation of these observations: orbital mechanics, satellite aerodynamics and upper atmospheric physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4489181-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335470-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132624-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238276-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144871-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189937-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212662-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136498-3>

A Story with Taste: The Nature of Synthetic Flavorings in the 20th Century, with Vanillin as an Example ¤ It is difficult to imagine food today without flavorings, whether natural, synthetic, or artificial. But at the same time, they are substances that society is viewing increasingly critically and whose chemical and industrial roots are under scrutiny. This volume tells the story of flavor production and regulation, discussing the potential naturalization of synthetic flavorings. Über Geschmack lässt sich nicht streiten. Oder doch?

Smartphone-Based 3D Indoor Localization and Navigation ¤ During the last century, navigation systems have become ubiquitous and guide drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians towards their desired destinations. While operating worldwide, they rely on line-of-sight conditions towards satellites and are thus limited to outdoor areas. However, finding a gate within an airport, a ward within a hospital, or a university's auditorium also represent navigation problems. To provide navigation within such indoor environments, new approaches are required. This thesis examines pedestrian 3D indoor localization and navigation using commodity smartphones: A desirable target platform, always at hand and equipped with a multitude of sensors. The IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and barometer allow for pedestrian dead reckoning, that is, estimating relative location changes. Absolute whereabouts can be determined via Wi-Fi, an infrastructure present within most public buildings, or by using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons as inexpensive supplement. The building's 3D floorplan not only enables navigation, but also increases accuracy by preventing impossible movements, and serves as a visual reference for the pedestrian. All aforementioned information is fused by recursive density estimation based on a particle filter. The conducted experiments cover both, theoretical backgrounds and real-world use-cases. All discussed approaches utilize the infrastructure found within most public buildings, are easy to set up, and maintain. Overall, this thesis results in an indoor localization and navigation system that can be easily deployed, without requiring any special hardware components.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4782098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4845922-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4633975-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4582612-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145152-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140907-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185821-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202971-5>
Performance studies for the KM3NeT neutrino telescope ¤ KM3NeT is a future neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea with an instrumented volume of a few cubic kilometres. The aim of the project is to detect cosmic neutrinos from sources like supernova remnants. To optimise the sensitivity while adhering to a given budget, detailed Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed, varying different detector parameters. The main focus was on a new detector design, which could not be studied in full detail before because of the lack of dedicated simulation and reconstruction tools. The work presents new tools and algorithms developed specifically for this new design. The results generated using these tools are presented and the sensitivity of KM3NeT to different source fluxes is discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171615-2>
Lasing and ion beam doping of semiconductor nanowires ¤ Semiconductor nanowires exhibit extraordinary optical properties like highly localized light emission, efficient waveguiding and light amplification. Even the stimulation of laser oscillations can be achieved at optical pumping, making nanowires promising for optoelectronic applications. For successful integration into future devices, three major key challenges have to be faced: 1) the understanding of the fundamental properties, 2) the modification of the emission characteristics and 3) the investigation of the efficiency-limiting factors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191263-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4218979-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4707308-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027606-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224496-1>
HFS and the brain : multiscale effects of electrical stimulation on a neurotransmitter system ¤ Abstract: Electrical deep brain stimulation has long been used as a therapeutic procedure to treat patients suffering from motor symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. However, the mechanism of action by which it operates is poorly understood with several conflicting hypothesis on its rationale. Illuminating this question might help us understand how and why secondary side effects such as depression and suicidality occur in some patients undergoing electrical high frequency stimulation.<br><br>In this study, based on previously reported results from our research group, the activation of the GABAergic system was studied from a microscopic scale to the effects that it has at a macroscopic behaving scale. We made use of the patch clamp technique to quantify the effects on the microscopic scale. While this quantification is possible using a system with extremely high signal to noise ratio, it becomes a larger problem when the mechanism is to be studied in animal models of disease, using conventional electrophysiology systems. The exploration of the algorithms used to bypass this problem showed us that the usage of these techniques cannot be blindly made, with additional validation techniques to verify that the data recorded is complete. <br><br>To this end, other measurement modalities were made use of to study the cascading effects in the brain as a result of the GABA activation- to study neurochemical and behavioral changes that occur due to electrical high frequency stimulation. We were able to see that the electrical stimulation did induce reduction in the extracellular levels of neurotransmitter responsible for mood regulation, and a corresponding change in the behavior profile was also observed.<br><br>Taken together, the results presented in this thesis helps further the idea that a selective activation of the GABAergic system is responsible for the effect that electrical stimulation has on neuronal tissue, with specific activation of the axonal elements,<br>which are the GABAergic axons. This activation is not limited to a microscopic level, but also to a mesoscopic level, which then leads to cascading effects that lead to significant behavioral changes, all mediated through the GABAergic system	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279564-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4394810-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4805645-5>
Visualising the Charge and Cooper-Pair Density Waves in Cuprates ¤ This thesis reports on the use of scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the atomic-scale electronic structure of a charge density wave, revealing that it has a d-symmetry form factor, hitherto unobserved in nature. It then details the development of an entirely new class of scanned probe: the scanning Josephson tunnelling microscope. This scans the Josephson junction formed between a cuprate superconducting microscope tip and the surface of a cuprate sample, thereby imaging the superfluid density of the sample with nanometer resolution. This novel method is used to establish the existence of a spatially modulated superconducting condensate, something postulated theoretically over half a century ago but never previously observed.

Analysis and modeling of transient earthquake patterns and their dependence on local stress regimes ¤ Investigations in the field of earthquake triggering and associated interactions, which includes aftershock triggering as well as induced seismicity, is important for seismic hazard assessment due to earthquakes destructive power. One of the approaches to study earthquake triggering and their interactions is the use of statistical earthquake models, which are based on knowledge of the basic seismicity properties, in particular, the magnitude distribution and spatiotemporal properties of the triggered events. In my PhD thesis I focus on some specific aspects of aftershock properties, namely, the relative seismic moment release of the aftershocks with respect to the mainshocks; the spatial correlation between aftershock occurrence and fault deformation; and on the influence of aseismic transients on the aftershock parameter estimation. For the analysis of aftershock sequences I choose a statistical approach, in particular, the well known Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, which accounts for the input of background and trigger...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4587352-5>
Polycentric water governance in Spain : understanding determinants, patterns, and performance of coordination ¤ Increasing irrigation efficiency has been high on the political agenda in Spain for many years. However, the overarching aim to reduce agricultural water consumption has not been met so far. Nora Schütze investigates processes of coordination between the water and agricultural sector in three Spanish river basins in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive implementation. From the perspective of polycentric governance, she identifies multiple mechanisms which illustrate how and why actors interact in certain ways, and thus shows why environmental aims of the Water Framework Directive remain unachieved	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138608-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124439-4>

Automated Connection of Simulation and Optimization Software for Parallel Solution of Inverse Problem Classes ¤ This work introduces a novel extension of the Python software ''Environment for Combining Optimization and Simulation Software'' (EFCOSS). The extension addresses the solution of optimization problems of different types. Various problem instances that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in new practical application scenarios include geothermal engineering and material science. In a more general context, EFCOSS enables to investigate the questions of which parameter values best fit a given computer model to measurements from real-world experiments, how should such experiments be designed with minimal uncertainty, which computer models should be used for a specific task, and how can the efficiency of such investigations be improved by using simpler models. These questions are addressed by employing techniques from parameter estimation, space mapping, optimal experimental design, and model identification that are implemented and brought together in EFCOSS. To this end, the internal structure of EFCOSS had to be redesigned completely to introduce a new software architecture based on standard Python packages. This new architecture allows for multiple optimization problems, objective functions, and simulation routines to be used within a single application. Simulation models of geothermal reservoirs in the regions of Perth in Australia and Tuscany in Italy are used as illustrating examples of optimal experimental design to find the location of new borehole sites that introduce low uncertainty in the parameter estimation. Furthermore, new parameter estimation problems are solved using space-mapping algorithms. Model identification is applied to metal-plasticity models to investigate different kinds of models. By combining automatic differentiation, parallelization, and reuse of intermediate results, the serial runtimes of the described problems are reduced from several weeks to minutes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4464685-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048716-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044614-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121138-8>
High-Resolution Experiments on Strong-Field Ionization of Atoms and Molecules : Test of Tunneling Theory, the Role of Doubly Excited States, and Channel-Selective Electron Spectra ¤ In this thesis, the ionization of atoms and small molecules in strong laser fields is experimentally studied using a reaction microscope. The population of autoionizing doubly excited states in the laser fields is proven and a possible connection to the well-known dielectronic recombination processes is discussed. The fundamental process of tunnel ionization in strong laser fields is subject of investigation in a pump-probe experiment with ultrashort laser pulses. A coherent superposition of electronic states in singly charged argon ions is created within the first, and subsequently tunnel-ionized with the second pulse. This gives access to state-selective information about the tunneling process and allows to test common models. Moreover, the ionization of krypton and argon at different wavelengths is studied, from the multiphoton to the tunneling regime. The wavelength-dependent investigations are furthermore extended to molecular hydrogen. In addition to ionization, this system might undergo different dissociative processes. Channel-selective electron momentum distributions are presented and compared to each other.

Influence of an alpha-Linolenic Acid-Rich, Hypoenergetic Diet on Body Weight, Clinical and Biochemical Parameters in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome ¤ metabolic syndrome; hypoenergetic diet; alpha-linolenic acid; obesity; n-3 fatty acids; cardiovascular risk; dietary study The metabolic syndrome (MBS) is influenced by overeating, lack of exercise and raised cardiovascular risk. Improved nutritional habits and an enduring weight reduction are essential for therapy. However, the optimal macronutrient composition and metabolically favourable food components, such as alpha-linolenic acid, are still a matter of debate. We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet over six month in patients with the MBS on body weight and risk profile as well as possible effects of an increased ALA-intake. The latter was realised by comparison of rapeseed oil and olive oil in two intervention groups. After intervention, body weight, blood pressure and parameters of lipid and endothelial metabolism as well as prevalence of the metabolic syndrome were significantly reduced. Differences between groups were investigated for significantly more declined diastolic blood pressure, concentrations of serum TAG as well as YKL-40 after rapeseed oil diet. This could indicate an individual effect of ALA.

Scattering Amplitudes and Wilson Loops in Twistor Space ¤ Scattering amplitudes are fundamental and rich observables in quantum field theory. Based on the observation that, for massless particles of spin-one or more, scattering amplitudes are much simpler than expected from traditional Feynman diagram techniques, the broad aim of this work is to understand and exploit this hidden structure. It uses methods from twistor theory to provide new insights into the correspondence between scattering amplitudes in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and null polygonal Wilson loops.

Mathematical modelling of host-disease-drug interactions in HIV disease ¤ The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has resisted nearly three decades of efforts targeting a cure. Sustained suppression of the virus has remained a challenge, mainly due to the remarkable evolutionary adaptation that the virus exhibits by the accumulation of drug-resistant mutations in its genome. Current therapeutic strategies aim at achieving and maintaining a low viral burden and typically involve multiple drugs. The choice of optimal combinations of these drugs is crucial, particularly in the background of treatment failure having occurred previously with certain other drugs. An understanding of the dynamics of viral mutant genotypes aids in the assessment of treatment failure with a certain drug combination, and exploring potential salvage treatment regimens. Mathematical models of viral dynamics have proved invaluable in understanding the viral life cycle and the impact of antiretroviral drugs. However, such models typically use simplified and coarse-grained mutation schemes, that curbs the extent of their application ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4798688-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200792-6>
Extraction and Evaluation of Geodata from Social Networks as an Element of Citizen Participation in Municipal Matters of the Hanseatic City of Rostock ¤ Within this work, a method has been developed which is able to geolocate tweets on a local scale, assign given topics and analyze them for trends and moods. It is special that this is settled in a German speaking area and a region with a low tweet density, the Hanseatic and university city of Rostock. Through the connection to the analogue world, valuable information can be generated and transferred from twitter. With this application it is possible to derive real time recommendations for action case of social events or extreme events. In the context of this work, a method has been developed that enables both in a region with a low density of Twitter messages, such as the Hanseatic and university city of Rostock, and in the German-speaking area, to geolocate tweets on a local scale, assign them to predefined topics, and analyze them in terms of mood and trends. From the spatiotemporal combination of the data, direct action recommendations can be derived in the event of extreme events or events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055762-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1104968363>
Thermal cis → trans isomerization of azobenzene studied by path sampling and QM/MM stochastic dynamics ¤ Azobenzene-based molecular photoswitches have extensively been applied to biological systems, involving photo-control of peptides, lipids and nucleic acids. The isomerization between the stable trans and the metastable cis state of the azo moieties leads to pronounced changes in shape and other physico-chemical properties of the molecules into which they are incorporated. Fast switching can be induced via transitions to excited electronic states and fine-tuned by a large number of different substituents at the phenyl rings. But a rational design of tailor-made azo groups also requires control of their stability in the dark, the half-lifetime of the cis isomer. In computational chemistry, thermally activated barrier crossing on the ground state Born-Oppenheimer surface can efficiently be estimated with Eyring’s transition state theory (TST) approach; the growing complexity of the azo moiety and a rather heterogeneous environment, however, may render some of the underlying simplifying assumptions problematic.

Trade and climate policies : the role of market structure, strategic behaviour, and the supply side of carbon ¤ Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is a global problem that has to be understood in the context of a globalising world with an increasing amount of goods being traded. This dissertation focuses on the interrelation between international trade and climate policies. It contributes to the literature from two perspectives: a demand side view by means of theoretical modelling, and a supply side view using numerical simulation. The first part of this dissertation uses general equilibrium trade models to analyse the effect of trade liberalisation on the environment. It shows that a trade-induced reallocation of production factors towards the most productive firms can explain part of sector-level changes in emission intensities. Moreover, if environmental policy is used strategically to substitute for trade policy, general equilibrium effects on firms’ markups need to be considered. The findings highlight that firm behaviour, factor reallocation across firms, and market structure all play a vital role for the impact of trade on the environment. The second part of this dissertation turns to the supply side of fossil fuels—the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It shows that fossil fuels are globally abundant despite uncertainties in local supply, for instance of unconventional natural gas. It is hence not a physical scarcity that solves the problem of climate change. Accordingly, climate policy has to target the use of fossil fuels. While the use of natural gas may be consistent with the transformation towards a low carbon energy system, the phase-out of coal is integral for climate change mitigation. By means of numerical simulations, the relation between climate policy and the international trade in natural gas and steam coal is investigated. Moreover, this dissertation analyses to what extent major steam coal exporters have a self-interest in restricting their supply.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023222-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
Long-term drainage effects on carbon fluxes of an Arctic permafrost ecosystem ¤ Permafrost landscapes in the Northern high latitudes with their massive organic carbon stocks are critically important for the global carbon cycle. Large uncertainties in the sustainability of these carbon pools under future climate conditions persist, caused by limited understanding of permafrost carbon cycling processes. A continuous observation program was established near the city of Chersky, NE Siberia, representing a wet tussock tundra ecosystem. Year-round eddy-covariance measurements focused on ecosystem–atmosphere exchange fluxes of carbon. Recent observations started mid-July 2013, while historic measurements are available for the period 2002–2005. Since 2004 part of the observation area has been disturbed by a circular drainage ditch, altering the soil water conditions in a way that is expected for degrading of ice-rich permafrost under a warming climate. In comparison to the strong reduction of fluxes immediately following the drainage disturbance in 2005, recent CO2 exchange with the atmosphere over this disturbed part of the tundra indicate a higher carbon turnover, and a seasonal amplitude that is comparable again to that within the control section. By comparing CO2 budgets from the drained and control ecosystems a systematically reduced sink strength within the drained area is found, dominated by increased respiration due to warmer near-surface soil layers. Reduced CH4 emissions are observed under drier and more aerobic conditions resulting in half the efflux from the drained ecosystem in comparison to the control ecosystem. As a net effect of the drainage an increased source of CO2, eq. to the atmosphere indicates a positive effect on global warming. Year-round measurements emphasize the importance of the non-growing season to the annual budget, with substantial contributions during the zero-curtain period representing the re-freezing of the active layer in fall.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129794-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152430-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164552-2>

Investigation and characterization of crystalline silicon solar cells for indoor and low light applications ¤ Abstract: Energy harvesting systems are electronic systems which harvest the needed energy from the ambiance and which are thus self-sufficient. Such systems find application in rather remote outdoor areas (e.g. in forests) or indoors. In both application scenarios, the available illumination densities are two to three orders of magnitude below the given illumination densities in standard photovoltaic applications. Therefore, the solar cell behavior under low illumination densities (0.1 mW/cm² to 10 mW/cm²) and under artificial light sources is of importance for the application of solar cells in energy harvesting systems. Within this work, the current state of the art for solar cells in indoor and low light applications is presented with the focus on solar cell characterization and optimization. This work offers new findings and approaches in both fields. For the characterization of solar cells under low illumination densities and under artificial light sources, three different characterization methods or approaches are presented in this work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4413737-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112704-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181740-0>

Light-induced pH cycle : a non-invasive method to control biochemical reactions ¤ Background Many biochemical reactions depend on the pH of their environment and some are strongly accelerated in an acidic surrounding. A classical approach to control biochemical reactions non-invasivly is by changing the temperature. However, if the pH could be controlled by optical means using photo-active chemicals, this would mean to be able to accelerate suitable biochemical reactions. Optically switching the pH can be achieved by using photoacids. A photoacid is a molecule with a functional group that releases a proton upon irradiation with the suitable wavelength, acidifying the environmental aqueous surrounding. A major goal of this work was to establish a non-invasive method of optically controlling the pH in aqueous solutions, offering the opportunity to enhance the known chemical reactions portfolio. To demonstrate the photo-switchable pH cycling we chose an enzymatic assay using acid phosphatase, which is an enzyme with a strong pH dependent activity.

Theory of Electronic and Optical Properties of Atomically Thin Films of Indium Selenide ¤ This thesis provides the first comprehensive theoretical overview of the electronic and optical properties of two dimensional (2D) Indium Selenide: atomically thin films of InSe ranging from monolayers to few layers in thickness. The thesis shows how the electronic propertes of 2D InSe vary significantly with film thickness, changing from a weakly indirect semiconductor for the monolayer to a direct gap material in the bulk form, with a strong band gap variation with film thickness predicted and recently observed in optical experiments. The proposed theory is based on a specially designed hybrid k.p tight-binding model approach (HkpTB), which uses an intralayer k.p Hamiltonian to describe the InSe monolayer, and tight-binding-like interlayer hopping. Electronic and optical absorption spectra are determined, and a detailed description of subbands of electrons in few-layer films and the influence of spin-orbit coupling is provided. The author shows that the principal optical excitations of InSe films with the thickness from 1 to 15 layers broadly cover the visible spectrum, with the possibility of extending optical functionality into the infrared and THz range using intersubband transitions Part I: Introduction and basics -- Scientiﬁc context and motivation -- Laser-plasmas -- Part II: Experimental methods -- High-power lasers -- Transportable Paul trap for isolated micro-targets in vacuum -- Part III: Laser-microplasma interactions -- Laser-driven ion acceleration using isolated micro-sphere targets -- Laser-driven micro-source for bi-modal radiographic imaging -- Part IV: Summary and perspectives -- Summary -- Challenges and perspectives -- Appendix	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046482-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382353-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292502-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182307-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123887-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4235053-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4250307-3>
Dualities, Helicity Amplitudes, and Little Conformal Symmetry ¤ Chapter 1. Electromagnetic Duality -- Chapter 2. Spinor Helicity Formalism -- Chapter 3. Non-Abelian Monopoles -- Chapter 4. Scattering Amplitudes -- Chapter 5. Little Conformal Symmetry. This thesis develops two exciting areas of particle physics research. It applies the recent new insights about the usefulness of helicity amplitudes in understanding gauge theory to the long-standing effort to understand theories with both electric and magnetic charges. It is known that for some supersymmetric theories there is an exact duality that relates two descriptions of the physics, one where the electric charges are weakly coupled and another where the electric charges are strongly coupled. The calculations in this thesis suggest that this duality can also hold in the low-energy limit of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories. The idea of addressing the hierarchy problem of the standard model Higgs mechanism using conformal symmetry is also explored. Analogously to “Little Higgs” models, where divergences are cancelled only at one-loop order, models are studied that have infrared conformal fixed points which related gauge and Yukawa couplings, allowing for a cancellation between seemingly unrelated quantum loop diagrams.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013161-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297710-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128574-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338328-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4231932-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225834-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058724-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4209328-4>
Fermi Surface and Quantum Critical Phenomena of High-Temperature Superconductors ¤ Introduction to Iron Based Superconductors -- Theory -- Experimental Setup -- BaFe2(As1-xPx)2-A Quantum Critical Superconductor -- LiFeAs and LiFeP-Stoichiometric Superconductors -- YBa2Cu408 -- Numerical Phase Sensitive Detection in Matlab -- Publications -- Bibliography. This thesis provides a detailed introduction to quantum oscillation measurement and analysis and offers a connection between Fermi surface properties and superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. It also discusses the field of iron-based superconductors and tests the models for the appearance of nodes in the superconducting gap of a 111-type pnictide using quantum oscillation measurements combined with band structure calculation. The same measurements were carried out to determine the quasiparticle mass in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2, which is strongly enhanced at the expected quantum critical point. While the lower superconducting critical field shows evidence of quantum criticality, the upper superconducting critical field is not influenced by the quantum critical point. These findings contradict conventional theories, demonstrating the need for a theoretical treatment of quantum critical superconductors, which has not been addressed to date. The quest to discover similar evidence in the cuprates calls for the application of extreme conditions. As such, quantum oscillation measurements were performed under high pressure in a high magnetic field, revealing a negative correlation between quasiparticle mass and superconducting critical temperature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4356922-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113982-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200190-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174945-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149002-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151629-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154016-5>

Rapid and Accurate 3D Shape Measurement using Pattern Projection and Stereo Image Acquisition in Thermal Infrared ¤ Three-dimensional shape measurement has become essential in many areas, such as quality control in industrial production or digitization of complex free-form surfaces. Stereo recording based on the principle of pattern projection is often used on diffusely reflecting surfaces. Objects with non-cooperative surfaces, such as transparent, shiny, absorbent, or translucent objects, could not be reliably recorded with this technology until now. In previous studies it was shown that the shape from heating approach can be used to record non-cooperative surfaces in three dimensions. This method is based on pattern projection in the thermal infrared, absorption under generation of a heat pattern, and stereo recording of the reemission. However, the measurement time in the double digit second range has been relatively long and the measurement accuracy insufficient for many applications. In this study, a simulation model for the entire thermal measurement process is developed. With the help of this tool, the interaction between the infrared radiation and the object as well as the generation of a temperature contrast is investigated. From this, limits of the multi-fringe projection are concluded and the novel projection principle of sequential fringes is developed. Instead of an areal multi-fringe projection, the new method irradiates the object only in locally strongly restricted areas. This results in irradiation times in the millisecond range, which drastically reduces the influence of thermal diffusion. The new 3D sensor based on sequential fringe projection has impressively demonstrated the advantages over multi-fringe projection. Besides the significant reduction of measurement times and improvement of measurement accuracy, the recordable material classes are extended to objects with higher thermal conductivity. The presented sensor is thus the world’s fastest and most accurate measurement system for high-resolution optical 3D shape measurement of non-cooperative surfaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042907-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161686-8>
Unraveling property-performance relationships in CO2 hydrogenation over iron-based catalysts ¤ This thesis deals with the development of iron-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and understanding of fundamentals relevant for activity and selectivity. The most decisive factors affecting activity and selectivity were identified by statistical approaches. The promotion effects of alkali metal promoter on CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-based catalysts were elucidated through characterization and kinetic analyses. This thesis also contributes to understanding of the interplay between physicochemical properties of promoter-free Fe-based catalyst and catalytic performance.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160891-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031648-8>
The Landscape of Free Fermionic Gauge Models ¤ In this thesis, the author describes the development of a software framework to systematically construct a particular class of weakly coupled free fermionic heterotic string models, dubbed gauge models. In their purest form, these models are maximally supersymmetric (N = 4), and thus only contain superpartners in their matter sector. This feature makes their systematic construction particularly efficient, and they are thus useful in their simplicity. The thesis first provides a brisk introduction to heterotic strings and the spin-structure construction of free fermionic models. Three systematic surveys are then presented, and it is conjectured that these surveys are exhaustive modulo redundancies. Finally, the author presents a collection of metaheuristic algorithms for searching the landscape for models with a user-specified spectrum of phenomenological properties, e.g. gauge group and number of spacetime supersymmetries. Such algorithms provide the groundwork for extended generic free fermionic surveys.

How political, spatial, and administrative changes shape the local level : evidence from municipalities ¤ Luisa Dörr prepared this study while she was working at the ifo Center for Public Finance and Political Economy. The study was completed in February 2022 and accepted as doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It consists of three distinct empirical essays investigating various aspects of regional development using data from Germany and Austria. Chapter 2 investigates how far-right populist mayors influence local political culture and economic outcomes. Chapter 3 examines how highway access affects commuting and employment in connected municipalities. Chapter 4 investigates the consequences of municipal mergers on fiscal equalization transfers. The chapters employ regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, and event study estimations to answer the respective research questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019990-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136757-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
The Digitalization of Measurement Data as a Precondition for the Integration of Renewable Energies into the Energy Supply System ¤ In 2017, the German legislator adopted a law that provides for the digitisation of the energy sector. The dissertation deals with legal issues raised by the provisions, especially those rules concerning the equipment of consumers with smart meters. Besides regulatory issues, the author examines the legitimacy of the proposed obligatory equipment. The main thesis of the dissertation is that the justification of interventions in the rights of market players presupposes that consumers can use smart meters sensibly. Today, this is not the case, since smart grids and intelligent electricity markets are lacking. The dissertation determines that profound changes in the energy industry are necessary for smart meters to support the integration of renewable energies into the energy supply system. As a response to the challenges caused by the energy transition, the federal legislator enacted the Law on the Digitalization of the Energy Industry in 2017, which raises numerous, previously unresolved legal questions. The work deals with regulatory issues in the foreground, but also examines whether the widespread, obligatory equipment with intelligent electricity meters, the smart meters, is lawful. The justification of interventions in the rights of market players presupposes that smart meters are usable in a sensible way. Currently, there is a lack of their integration into modern distribution networks, smart grids, and on the consumer side, a further developed electricity market, smart market, on which services for the beneficial use of smart meters are offered. The analysis shows that profound changes in the energy industry are necessary for smart meters to be able to promote the integration of renewable energies into the energy supply system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152243-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7703133-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5>
Biotic and abiotic control of microbial community structure and activity in forest soils ¤ Microorganisms are the key drivers of most processes in soil. Therefore, factors regulating microbial composition, functions and activities are hot topics in soil science. Focusing on forest ecosystems, this PhD aimed to evaluate: i) abiotic (temperature and precipitation) and biotic (trees species identity) factors regulating the composition of microbial communities in forest soils, ii) the effects of forest biodiversity on microbial decomposition of organic polymeric compounds of plant litter and iii) the effects of intrinsic properties of common low molecular weight organic substances (L...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>
Mixed-valent phosphorus compounds synthesis, characterization and reactivity ¤ The objectives of this work were the synthesis of mixed-valent phosphorus compounds including related precursor reagents and investigations of their reactivity. The synthetic approach of salt metathesis of phosphinic chlorides with alkali metal phosphanides, which was believed to be straightforward to achieve mixed-valent compounds, resulted in unexpected reaction sequences and products. Optimizing the composition of the reagents and altering the substitution on the $\\[3\]-phosphorus made it possible to observe the target molecules in solution and some derivates in the solid state. However, the stability of a PP double bond is inferior compared to a CC double bond which could be observed by degradation of target molecules in solution. Recently published results in this field suggest the possibility to utilize mixed-valent phosphorus compounds as phosphinidene transfer reagents. Thus, the degradation of target molecules was intensively studied by kinetic measurements using phosphorus NMR techniques.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174379-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045855-6>
A grid-adaptive algebraic hybrid RANS/LES method ¤ The present thesis considers the compressible Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the flow of air about basic and complex test cases. As numerical solution method the unstructured finite-volume solver DLR-TAU is used. The aim of the work is to provide a hybrid RANS/LES simulation strategy for the reliable numerical prediction of the stall behavior of high-lift airfoils under the influence of turbulent inflow.

Fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in aqueous media ¤ This dissertation focuses on the investigation and development of an optical biosensor based on fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) that provides chemical selective and sensitive label-free detection of biomolecules. FERS has been achieved by using various types of liquid core optical fibers, which guide the light within the liquid sample and increase the interaction length with the analyte molecules. The first part of this dissertation explains the FERS technique in detail and describes the current state of research of FERS. Several essential characteristics, such as fiber length, attenuation, material and refractive index, are thoroughly discussed in considerations of Raman intensity enhancement. Liquid-core fibers formed with hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCFs) and polymer fibers are introduced and discussed, as they are the most important breakthroughs. The objective of this research is to develop a robust optical fiber platform based on Raman spectroscopy that shows potential for use in bio-analytical and clinical applications. In this work, I demonstrate a combination of UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy (UV-RRS) and liquid-core fibers, to increases the sensitivity for the detection of low-concentrated pharmaceuticals tremendously. This combined enhancement technique was applied for the detection of bile pigments for monitoring of diseases related to hyperbilirubinemia and hyperbiliverdinemia. Their poor optical quality strongly limits the performances of the polymer-based liquid-core fibers. Therefore, the implementation of HC-PCFs was explored in two different types of optical guiding. Waveguiding in the visible range is achieved for the first time in both kinds of liquid-filled HC-PCFs, and therefore the Raman scattering wavelengths are not anymore limited to the insensitive NIR range. In order to achieve easy-to-use and stable FERS devices for further development, the performance of HC-PCFs in the aspect of light-confinement was studied with the help of a specially designed multi-channel Raman chemical imaging. The optimal fiber length, spatial filtering, and optical coupling were thoroughly analyzed, and an automatic coupling system was developed. With the development of optical fibers, FERS shows increasing potential as a robust, fast, chemical selective and sensitive tool for the detection of biomolecules in clinical, pharmaceutical, and biological applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193016-2>
Multi-telescope studies of neutron stars ¤ Neutron stars are unique stellar remnants with extreme properties, as their density and magnetic field. Their study can be the key to a number of unanswered problems in fundamental physics and astronomy, ranging from stellar evolution to strong field gravity. One of the best ways of studying these objects is with observations at radio wavelengths, the efficiency of which can be vastly improved with the combination of data from multiple radiotelescopes. In this thesis, we use the largest European radiotelescopes for performing high quality studies of the properties of objects belonging into two separate categories of neutron stars, millisecond pulsars and magnetars. In the first part of this thesis, a complete description of the observing systems and calibration procedures for the multiple telescopes used is presented. Specifically, all observations were made with the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) telescopes, which are the Effelsberg 100m radiotelescope in Germany, the Lovell 76m radiotelescope in UK, the Westerbork 94m equivalent synthesis radiotelescope in the Netherlands and the Nan"cay 94m equivalent decimetric radiotelescope in France ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171660-7>
Markov Analyses of Rough Surfaces ¤ BEGIN: This thesis describes the adaption and development of the Markov analysis method for the analysis of the topographies of rough surfaces. The Markov analysis characterizes and describes stochastic systems by means of a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of conditional probability densities (pdf) in the scale variable. The method and its tools are thus extended to a class of measurement data which previously has been investigated to only little extend. The extension of the Markov analysis to the characterization of surface roughness enables new insights about the method, its applications and limitations. <engl.> In this work, the Markov analysis method is adapted and further developed for the investigation and characterization of surface topographies.

Search for New Phenomena in Top-Antitop Quarks Final States with Additional Heavy-Flavour Jets with the ATLAS Detector ¤ BEGIN Introduction -- The ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider -- Reconstruction of physics objects -- Data and Event simulations -- Signal and background modeling -- Optimisations of heavy object tagging and event categorisation -- Analysis strategy -- Systematic uncertainties -- Statistical analysis -- Results -- Discussion -- Prospect -- Conclusion This book reports on the search for a new heavy particle, the Vector-Like Top quark (VLT), in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The signal process is the pair production of VLT decaying into a Higgs boson and top quark (TT→Ht+X, X=Ht, Wb, Zt). The signal events result in top–antitop quarks final states with additional heavy flavour jets. The book summarises the analysis of the data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. In order to better differentiate between signals and backgrounds, exclusive taggers of top quark and Higgs boson were developed and optimised for VLT signals. These efforts improved the sensitivity by roughly 30%, compared to the previous analysis. The analysis outcomes yield the strongest constraints on parameter space in various BSM theoretical models. In addition, the book addresses detector operation and the evaluation of tracking performance. These efforts are essential to properly collecting dense events and improving the accuracy of the reconstructed objects that are used for particle identification. As such, they represent a valuable contribution to data analysis in extremely dense environments END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183523-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240945-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4746359-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142739-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375595-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185791-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4398783-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4492282-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297710-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4360012-8>

Applying the effect-response framework in the tropics : links between plant functional traits, the abiotic environment, and ecosystem functioning at Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania ¤ The present work investigates the responses of plants to abiotic environmental conditions and their effects on ecosystem properties. It builds on the notion of the effect-response framework. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania served as a model system, where plant functional traits of the most abundant and widespread species were collected. The main part of this dissertation consists of three chapters to be published as research articles. The first of the main chapters investigates the niche breadths of plant species along environmental gradients and addresses the question whether plant functional traits can predict corresponding niche optima. The second study deals with the variance of trait values within and between plant communities in relation to environmental conditions. In the third main chapter, it is investigated whether plant functional traits, the abiotic environment, or both combined influence mean animal body mass in taxonomically defined groups or feeding guilds. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045539-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043216-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124348-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292953-2>
The effect of root volatiles on the orientation behaviour of cockchafer larvae in the soil ¤ The present study investigates the effect of root volatiles on the orientation behaviour of cockchafer larvae Melolontha hippocastani in the soil. Cockchafer larvae are known as severe pests in agriculture and forestry. The present study adresses three relevant aspects of their chemical ecology linked to food choice belowground: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of several potential host plant roots and shoots are investigated and analysed by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The obtained volatile patterns of damaged roots differ clearly from the undamaged ones. Emitted shoot volatiles differ clearly from the emitted root volatiles. Electrophysiological methods are employed to record sensory reactions of the detached larval antennae to several of the previously identified compounds. Volatile emissions of Quercus sp. are investigated in detail. By using electroantennography (EAG), changes in the receptor potential elicited by odour stimuli are recorded. It turns out that seasonal and maybe also circadian rhythms appear to play an important role in cockchafer larvae antenna physiology. The behavioural response of cockchafer larvae is tested on selected compounds. A dual choice test setup is designed to study the behavioural orientation of the belowground living larvae. Attractive and repellent compounds in host plants are identified. Preparative methods show the antennal lobes (ALs, first central processing unit for olfactory information processing in the insect brain) of 3rd instar of M. hippocastani to contain a high number of glomeruli, which are regarded as the functional subunits of odour discrimination ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351499-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166781-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172826-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136391-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278224-7>
An Efficient Approach to Translation between Service Protocols through Modeling of Behavioral Differences ¤ For developers, the integration of service protocols into applications is still a tedious and time-consuming task. This problem can be solved by programming software that converts one protocol to another. Thereby, design-patterns, data transformation technologies or manual coding are used to integrate these protocols. Also, several model-driven solutions can be used that focus on the formal description of protocols to automatically generate converters. This thesis describes a model-driven approach that has been designed to convert service protocols into each other. The approach focuses on the modeling of the differences between protocols. The differences in the communication behavior are described using patterns, while the state of a service can be described using decision trees. The evaluation contains an analysis of the processing times of the patterns as well as a comparison with other model-driven approaches.

In dieser Arbeit wird ein neues Modellierungsverfahren vorgestellt, das speziell für die Konvertierung von Service-Protokollen entwickelt wurde. Der Ansatz konzentriert sich auf die Modellierung von Protokollunterschieden und erlaubt die Beschreibung von Änderungen des Kommunikationsverhaltens mittels Mustern. Darüber hinaus können Zustände durch Entscheidungsbäume abgebildet werden.

Ontomediality : a media-philosophical perspective on the current re-negotiation of ontology ¤ This book focuses on a monstrous change: from living beings to worlds of processing, exposing a radical indistinguishability of mediality and ontology. In the 21st century, we are witnesses to a massive ontological shift: the traditional boundaries between culture and nature, subject and object, and the idea of a world consisting of independent entities are giving way to a relational world in the making in the age of powerful networks of cybercapitalism and the Anthropocene. From a media-philosophical perspective, Lisa Handel asks how the question of being moves within this re-negotiation of ontology in the horizon of the question of technology. Where the emergence of world appears infinitely medial and technical, we are already in the midst of the coming world of ontomediality - with all its new dangers and possibilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075660-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1064946224> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137176-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1028331568> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4712994-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6>
Multiple classifier systems in human-computer interaction ¤ Making the interaction of human subjects with technical systems more intuitive is a quickly emerging interdisciplinary field of research. One important aspect of this field is the surveillance of the user by the respective system and thus enabling it to estimate distinct user states. The automatic recognition of user states in human-computer interaction poses a great challenge to statistical pattern recognition for several reasons: The measurements of the different sensors are inherently heterogeneous in their technical properties, for example considering sample rates, range of values or resolution. Another important aspect is the fact that the true state of a subject is generally not entirely observable from the outside, which makes the design of corpora that study human-computer interaction extremely difficult. This leads in many cases to weakly or subjectively defined class labels by either using human test persons that annotate the collected material manually or by using externally triggered stimuli that are designed to elicit distinct predefined states. In order to approach the recognition of user states in human-computer interaction, the multi-modal and the temporal properties of the application are exploited in this work. For this purpose, different information fusion architectures based on multiple classifier system approaches and temporal integration techniques are introduced and discussed. Besides this, the incorporation of unlabeled data into the training of the classifier is a compelling issue since one is generally short of training data as described earlier. This work will introduce a partially supervised learning approach, that combines unsupervised and supervised learning in order to extend the amount of usable data. Finally, the problem of imbalanced class distributions is tackled by a class weighting mechanism in the training of support vector machines, which increases the loss for the underrepresented class.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4784306-8>
Blended Learning in Driver Education : Contexts of Justification - Influencing Factors - Constitutive Features ¤ E-learning has been a standard preparation tool for the driving test for many years.

Interference Coordination for Femtocell Networks ¤ Femto-BSs, also known as home evolved NodeB (HeNB), are low-power and small scale BSs that are deployed within traditional macro-cellular networks. With these so-called small cells, the spatial reuse of radio resources is tremendously boosted, wall penetration losses are largely mitigated, and users can enjoy high data rates. In addition to its various advantages, the deployment of femtocells also comes with some problems and one of the main issues is the increase in interference. The interference mitigation in femtocell networks is the main aim of this thesis. In order to achieve this goal, the characteristics and interference environment of femtocell deployments have been investigated, and the properties of interference mitigation techniques applicable to such networks are studied. To this end, dynamic central and distributed resource assignment methods have been developed where network can update itself depending on the changes in the interference environment. Furthermore, the application of the developed techniques in real network deployments such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) have been studied. Although the focus is on femtocell networks, the developed methods in this thesis can be applied to any wireless networks with minor changes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1073707296>
Role of bacterial biofilms and extracellular polymeric substances in the colloidal stability and transport of hematite nanoparticles in synthetic porous media ¤ The heterogeneous physicochemical properties of biofilm and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in deciding the fate of transport of nanoparticles in subsurface. However, contrasting results have been observed for the mobility of different nanoparticle transport in porous media coated with biofilms. Also, no comparative studies have been done linking the effect of biofilms on colloidal stability and mobility of colloids to date. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to obtain insights into different ways bacterial biofilms and EPS can influence the transport of nanoparticles in porous media. Using complementary experimental approaches, we investigated (1) the effect of microbial EPS on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles, (2a.) the transport of uncoated colloidal nanoparticles in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, (2b.) the transport of EPS-coated colloidal nanoparticles in uncoated porous media (2c), the combined transport of EPS-coated colloids in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, and finally (3) the remobilization of deposited colloidal nanoparticles by EPS. Laboratory synthesized hematite nanoparticles (HNP) and Bacillus subtilis 168 (DSM 402) were used as nanoparticles and biofilm forming bacterium respectively. To study the effect of EPS on the colloidal stability, HNP were amended with three increasing concentrations of EPS (20, 200 and 500 mg/l carbon) resulting in carbon:iron ratios 1:5, 2:1 and 5:1, respectively. The zeta potential (ZP), the shift in isoelectric point and the change in the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) for NaCl and CaCl2 showed formation of colloidally stable organo-mineral colloids at higher concentrations of EPS (200 mg/l and 500 mg/l of carbon, HNP2:1, HNP 5:1). However, lower concentrations of EPS (20 mg/l carbon, HNP 1:5) resulted into aggregation of HNP. The transport of uncoated and EPS-coated HNP colloids at environmental pH was studied with closed flow columns experiments in three different synthetic porous media, i.e., uncoated, biofilm-coated, and EPS-coated glass beads. No drastic change was observed in the pH and the electrical conductivity of the system during the transport experiments. However, a constant amount of organic matter and bacterial cells were continuously released from the porous media coatings. In the first scenario, positively charged uncoated HNP were immobile and retained in uncoated-glass bead porous media. Contrary, a mobile fraction of negatively charged HNP was observed in biofilms and EPS-coated porous media. The charge reversal of HNP during transport is due to adsorption of organic matter released from the coatings forming organomineral associations of HNP and components of the biofilm or EPS.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164695-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443397-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232790-8>
All inkjet printed piezoelectric polymer actuators for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems ¤ Printing technologies for the fabrication of electronic components have emerged in recent years and have attracted interest due to their capabilities of cost-effective material deposition and their suitability for large-area coatings. In this thesis, the benefits of inkjet printing technologies are used to manufacture piezoelectric actuators that are suitable for integration in polymer-based, disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Based on analytical models of actuator behavior, piezoelectric actuators with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) as the active material are inkjet printed and characterized in detail for the first time here. The thermal treatment applied to the P(VDF-TrFE) films exhibits a significant influence on device performance and morphology. Annealing at temperatures between 110 and 140 °C yields distinct piezoelectric behavior. These findings are employed to demonstrate the function of a membrane pump with an inkjet printed actuator with pump rates up to 130 µL/min, which is suitable for applications in LOC systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the manufacturing approach introduced here as well as the established knowledge about the behavior of inkjet printed P(VDF-TrFE) actuators are novel. The low processing temperatures and the use of digital printing technologies lead to cost-effective processing compared to conventional, lithography- and vacuum-based manufacturing approaches. Different from most current micropumps, an additional assembly step is not required, which would be necessary when an actuator is manufactured separately and then attached to the pump membrane. Furthermore, the manufacturing approach and design introduced here are compatible with processes and materials that are used in LOC systems. They allow a cost-effective integration of further functionalities, leading to a higher degree of integration and thus smarter systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7658522-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4568836-9>
High-Resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Microscopy : Imaging of Artificial and Biological Specimens with Laser-Driven Ultrafast XUV Sources ¤ This book provides a comprehensive overview of the technique of frequency conversion of ultrafast lasers towards the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime, starting with the frequency conversion scheme and its technical implementation as well as general considerations of diffraction-based imaging at nanoscopic spatial resolutions. The last few centuries have seen continual advances in optical microscopy, driven by the demand to image ever-smaller objects. In recent years, frequency conversion of ultrafast lasers towards the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime has significantly enhanced the achievable resolution thanks to shorter wavelengths. The absence of high-magnification optics in the XUV regime is a major issue associated with this technique and is tackled with direct measurement and reconstruction of coherent diffraction patterns. The experimental application of this technique in terms of digital in-line holography and coherent-diffraction imaging is demonstrated on artificial and biological specimens. The book introduces a novel, award-winning cancer-cell classification scheme based on biological imaging. Finally, it presents a newly developed technique for generating structured illumination in the XUV regime and demonstrates its usability for super-resolution imaging	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342332-2>
Synthesis, Characterization, and Application of Stable Organic Radicals as Spin Probes for Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy ¤ EPR spectroscopy ('electron paramagnetic resonance') is an analytical method for the characterization of paramagnetic compounds. Stable organic radicals are widely used probes for different EPR applications. EPR spectra are influenced by different parameters such as oxygen concentration and pH in organs and tissues. Thus, biological applications of EPR include e. g. the quantitative determination of oxygen levels and pH in tissues and organs. It is therefore an important analytical tool for medicinal research and a potentially useful tool for medicinal diagnostics. The aim of this work was to optimize and characterize three types of organic radicals directly by structure variation und indirectly by encapsulation of radicals in lipophilic and hydrophilic gels. The applicability of the new and encapsulated radicals for different EPR applications was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Radical types which were investigated in this study are nitroxides, triarylmethyle radicals und galvinoxyls.

Herbivore-induced changes in the plants' proteome and the role of atypical herbivore-responsive proteins in Nicotiana attenuata ¤ Since plants are largely immobile, they have evolved a large degree of physiological plasticity to cope with fluctuating environments. Plastic responses to herbivore attack involve transcriptional reorganizations and increases in hormone concentrations, enzyme activities, and secondary metabolite levels. Plants respond polygenetically to herbivores with different feeding habits by large transcriptomic reorganization upon herbivory. A comparative proteomic analysis examined whether the large-scale changes in transcriptome also translated into large-scale changes in the proteome.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4416206-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4626532-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174847-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195374-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4596545-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4775956-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159584-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020136-3>
Natural product biosynthesis in the genus Herpetosiphon : a genomics and chemistry-guided evaluation ¤ A previous study revealed the presence of a diterpene synthase in H. aurantiacus DSM 785. Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled glucose led to the discovery of its possible metabolic product herpetopanone. In addition, chemical analysis allowed the discovery of five known products from Herpetosiphon spp. including two diketopiperazines, futalosine and its derivative, as well as N-acetyl-tryptophan. In order to increase species richness and reveal metabolic diverse of the genus Herpetosiphon, three unclassified Herpetosiphon spp. and a Herpetosiphon giganteus bacterium from DSMZ were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data it was concluded that Herpetosiphon sp. Hp g472 represents a novel species of the genus Herpetosiphon. In addition, an emended description of H. giganteus was proposed in this study. All bacteria in the genus Herpetosiphon are capable of predation. Genome mining of Herpetosiphon spp. revealed that they harbor a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters. Up to now, three new compounds were reported from the type species H. aurantiacus DSM 785, but the genomic potential for natural product biosynthesis is much larger. The phylum Chloroflexi is one of the deepest bacterial lineages and consists of species with various phenotypes and genotypes. Terpene synthases, especially phytoene synthases, are widely distributed in this phylum. In addition, Ktedonobacter racemifer from the genus Ktedonobacter has the ability to produce resistomycin analogs based on genome analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326022-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264758-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3>
Design principles of plant photosensory networks : quantitative analysis and modelling of phytochrome dimer dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana ¤ Summary: For plants as sessile organisms the acclimatisation to environmental fluctuations is the most essential, critical and at the same time challenging process to evolve plasticity (Smith, 1982, 2000). Such acclimatisation processes require refined sensitive mechanisms, including a variety of different light sensing photoreceptors (Smith, 1982; Montgomery and Lagarias, 2002). Phytochromes are the most important photoreceptors in plants regulating several essential developmental changes like seed germination and de-etiolation as well as stem elongation (Figure 1.1). However, the two major phytochromes phyA and phyB exhibit dramatic differences in their action spectra for physiological responses, with phyB being most active in red light and phyA in far red light (Casal et al., 1998). These differences cannot be explained by the photo-physical properties of the phytochromes, because these are virtually identical for all phytochromes (Eichenberg et al., 2000)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149938-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174633-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141299-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375281-0>
Earthquake Microzonation of Lörrach and Weil am Rhein, Southern Upper Rhine Graben ¤ BEGIN: The densely populated border triangle Germany-France-Switzerland is situated at the south-eastern Upper Rhine Graben. This area is one prominent region of earthquake hazard in central Europe. Accordingly, on the German side an earthquake zonation map is used. However, in case of an earthquake the local ground motion might show significant variations even at short distances, due to several factors including the local geology and tectonics, the so called site effects. Earthquake microzonation maps were developed to describe such site effects. A qualitative earthquake microzonation map of greater Lörrach, an urban area in Germany, was developed during this study, to describe relative attenuation (deamplification) and amplification of near-surface seismic waves in the investigation area. This study focused on developing a microzonation approach. The approach presented in this study is based primarily on the three columns; geological information, ambient vibration measurements and earthquake recordings...

Experimental and Model-Based Investigation of FKV Connection Elements under Static and Cyclic Loading ¤ This Work presents a detailed experimental study on carbon fibre (CF) polyether etherketone (PEEK) composites fasteners designed to join conventional high performance composites (CFRP). The failure mechanisms of two CF-PEEK fasteners with countersunk heads joining two laminate plates in a single-lap configuration were investigated under static (tensile) and cyclic loading (tension-tension). The failure process of the bolted joints is described in detail using acoustic emission and microscopic cut views. The experimental results are in good agreement with the newly developed “closed-form” model. This enhanced analytical approach is a closed-form extension of the spring based method, where bolts and laminates are represented by an arrangement of springs and masses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4720368-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128805-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300116-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210353-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146268-3>

Pore water expulsion at submarine cold seeps : geochemical evidence for short-cuts between crust, sediments and ocean ¤ Active pore water expulsion from marine sediments has been observed on continental margins worldwide and is therefore considered a potentially important link in global geochemical cycles. Understanding element recycling through submarine fluid discharge on a global scale requires a profound knowledge of the fluids&rsquo; origin and the geochemical processes affecting their composition. The present thesis investigates the chemical and isotopic (delta7Li, 87Sr/86Sr, 129I/I) composition of cold seep fluids as a function of the tectonic context, the lithology and thickness of ambient sediments and other relevant geological factors	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288836-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129066-5>
Robust Adaptation to Non-Native Accents in Automatic Speech Recognition ¤ Speech recognition technology is being increasingly employed in human-machine interfaces. A remaining problem however is the robustness of this technology to non-native accents, which still cause considerable difficulties for current systems. In this book, methods to overcome this problem are described. A speaker adaptation algorithm that is capable of adapting to the current speaker with just a few words of speaker-specific data based on the MLLR principle is developed and combined with confidence measures that focus on phone durations as well as on acoustic features. Furthermore, a specific pronunciation modelling technique that allows the automatic derivation of non-native pronunciations without using non-native data is described and combined with the previous techniques to produce a robust adaptation to non-native accents in an automatic speech recognition system	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438849-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116579-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140553-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003961-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041354-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327834-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126481-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284757-6>

Querying heterogeneous data in an in-situ unified agile system ¤ Data integration provides a unified view of data by combining different data sources. In today’s multi-disciplinary and collaborative research environments, data is often produced and consumed by various means, multiple researchers operate on the data in different divisions to satisfy various research requirements, and using different query processors and analysis tools. This makes data integration a crucial component of any successful data intensive research activity. The fundamental difficulty is that data is heterogeneous not only in syntax, structure, and semantics, but also in the way it is accessed and queried. We introduce QUIS (QUery In-Situ), an agile query system equipped with a unified query language and a federated execution engine. It is capable of running queries on heterogeneous data sources in an in-situ manner. Its language provides advanced features such as virtual schemas, heterogeneous joins, and polymorphic result set representation. QUIS utilizes a federation of agents to transform a given input query written in its language to a (set of) computation models that are executable on the designated data sources. Federative query virtualization has the disadvantage that some aspects of a query may not be supported by the designated data sources. QUIS ensures that input queries are always fully satisfied. Therefore, if the target data sources do not fulfill all of the query requirements, QUIS detects the features that are lacking and complements them in a transparent manner. QUIS provides union and join capabilities over an unbound list of heterogeneous data sources; in addition, it offers solutions for heterogeneous query planning and optimization. In brief, QUIS is intended to mitigate data access heterogeneity through query virtualization, on-the-fly transformation, and federated execution. It offers in-Situ querying, agile querying, heterogeneous data source querying, unified execution, late-bound virtual schemas, and Remote execution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011149-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201275-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4378490-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148871-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1168760348> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1>
Formulation of Statistical Mechanics Based on Thermal Pure Quantum States ¤ This thesis introduces the concept of "thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states", which are pure quantum states in equilibrium. The author establishes a new formulation of statistical mechanics based on the TPQ states. This formulation allows us to obtain not only mechanical variables but also thermodynamic variables such as entropy and free energy from a single TPQ state. Furthermore, the formulation provides a new physical description in which all fluctuations including thermally driven ones are uniquely identified to be quantum fluctuations. The use of TPQ formulation has practical advantages in its application to numerical computations and allows for significant reduction in computation cost in numerics. For demonstration purposes, a numerical computation based on TPQ formulation is applied to a frustrated two-dimensional quantum spin model, and the result is also included in this book. .

Elucidation of fundamental amino acid synthesis pathways of Streptococcus pneumoniae by isotopologue profiling and the impact of glutamine deficiency on bacterial virulence ¤ Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are human pathogens, which are able to pass the host nasopharyngeal barriers and cause severe diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. As pneumococci are members of the order of lactobacillales, the major catabolite of carbohydrate metabolism under aerobe and microaerophilic atmosphere is lactate. However S. pneumoniae synthesizes also a large fraction of ABC transporter systems involved in uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates, soluble compounds and amino acids. Here we started to analyze carbon metabolism by 13C isotopologue perturbation after growth of pneumococci in chemically defined media (CDM) in the presence of [U-13C6]glucose or [1,2-13C2]glucose as the sole C-source. GC/MS analysis showed a pattern of labeled and non labeled amino acids. The results suggest that pneumococci take up specific amino acids, while others are synthesized de novo by classical or non-classical biosynthesis pathways. His, Glu, Ile, Leu, Val, Pro and Gly remain unlabeled, which is a hint for the lack of de novo synthesis pathways or their regulation under certain environmental conditions. Strikingly, the data for the essential branched amino acids (BAA; Ile, Leu and Val) are unexpected, as genes encoding enzymes required for the synthesis were annotated (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Moreover, Asp is not synthesized via the general pathway including pyruvate and acetyl-CoA ...

Determinants of the voluntary provision of public goods : experimental Investigations ¤ The private provision of public goods (PPPG) is still one of the most fascinating puzzles in economics. Underpredicted by standard economic theory but outrightly evident in empirical evidence, its presence opened doors for new methods to enter the economist's toolkit and helped birthing the nowadays more vibrant than ever field of behavioral economics. Variants of the question of what determines giving in PPPG make up, for the most part, the research questions of the five articles that constitute this dissertation. Residing on the overlap of public economics, environmental economics, and behavioral/experimental economics, it reports on two field-experimental and one lab-experimental projects, delivering results with respect to, for example, the price elasticity of giving to public goods, the willingness to pay for a voluntary one-ton emissions reduction, the pronounced effect of education on PPPG, the 'pure' effect of group size in public good provision, and the effects of ambient noise and outdoor temperature on PPPG.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438961-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043179-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4518982-1>
Building high-quality merged ontologies from multiple sources with requirements customization ¤ Ontologies are the prime way of organizing data in the Semantic Web. Often, it is necessary to combine several, independently developed ontologies to obtain a knowledge graph fully representing a domain of interest. Existing approaches scale rather poorly to the merging of multiple ontologies due to using a binary merge strategy. Thus, we aim to investigate the extent to which the n-ary strategy can solve the scalability problem. This thesis contributes to the following important aspects: 1. Our n-ary merge strategy takes as input a set of source ontologies and their mappings and generates a merged ontology. For efficient processing, rather than successively merging complete ontologies pairwise, we group related concepts across ontologies into partitions and merge first within and then across those partitions. 2. We take a step towards parameterizable merge methods. We have identified a set of Generic Merge Requirements (GMRs) that merged ontologies might be expected to meet. We have investigated and developed compatibilities of the GMRs by a graph-based method. 3. When multiple ontologies are merged, inconsistencies can occur due to different world views encoded in the source ontologies To this end, we propose a novel Subjective Logic-based method to handling the inconsistency occurring while merging ontologies. We apply this logic to rank and estimate the trustworthiness of conflicting axioms that cause inconsistencies within a merged ontology. 4. To assess the quality of the merged ontologies systematically, we provide a comprehensive set of criteria in an evaluation framework. The proposed criteria cover a variety of characteristics of each individual aspect of the merged ontology in structural, functional, and usability dimensions. 5. The final contribution of this research is the development of the CoMerger tool that implements all aforementioned aspects accessible via a unified interface.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4520890-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4688372-1>
Effect of mass wasting on soil organic carbon storage and coastal erosion in permafrost environments ¤ Accelerated permafrost thaw under the warming Arctic climate can have a significant impact on Arctic landscapes. Areas underlain by permafrost store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Permafrost disturbances may contribute to increased release of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. Coastal erosion, amplified through a decrease in Arctic sea-ice extent, may also mobilise SOC from permafrost. Large expanses of permafrost affected land are characterised by intense mass-wasting processes such as solifluction, active-layer detachments and retrogressive thaw slumping. Our aim is to assess the influence of mass wasting on SOC storage and coastal erosion. We studied SOC storage on Herschel Island by analysing active-layer and permafrost samples, and compared non-disturbed sites to those characterised by mass wasting. Mass-wasting sites showed decreased SOC storage and material compaction, whereas sites characterised by material accumulation showed increased storage. The SOC storage on Herschel Island is also significantly …	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015366-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129794-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191504-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169027-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164538-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033469-7>
Electron positron pair production in strong electric fields ¤ This work covers electron positron pair production in spatially homogeneous electric (and magnetic) fields. Different field configurations are looked at in order to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production, Sauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The main focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component which are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via different numerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic method is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which entails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of this equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the DHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic fields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical method is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore called the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to understand pair production in these rotating Sauter pulses. In those studies the Wigner method and the semiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each other. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the rotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for experiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An interpretation of the resulting pair production spectra is given. Due to the general nature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field configurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirped pulses or bichromatic rotating Sauter pulses. Each of these exhibit interesting features, including the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect in bichromatic pulses, which could be useful in planning high-intensity laser experiments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175441-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296820-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130722-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125978-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1149700009> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150564-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173045-8>
Indoloquinoline-oligonucleotide conjugates in the antigene strategy : binding and NMR structural studies ¤ Triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are one of the most specific DNA duplex binding agents and offer new perspectives towards oligonucleotide-mediated gene regulation and manipulation. However, the poor thermodynamic stability of DNA triplexes under physiological conditions limits a successful application in the antigene strategy. Thus, the conjugation of TFOs with small triplex-specific binding ligands is a promising approach to stabilize the formed complexes and to enhance their overall binding affinity. The present study focused on the synthesis of novel TFO conjugates with triplex-binding indolo[3,2-b]quinoline derivatives (PIQ) and on their ability to form and stabilize intermolecular triplexes through their recognition of a duplex target. During the course of the work the thermodynamics of conjugate binding and structural aspects of drug-DNA interactions have been characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques.

Analysis of supramolecular assemblies of NE81, the first lamin protein in a non-metazoan organism ¤ Nuclear lamins are nucleus-specific intermediate filaments forming a network located at the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope. They form the nuclear lamina together with proteins of the inner nuclear membrane regulating nuclear shape and gene expression, among others. The amoebozoan Dictyostelium NE81 protein is a suitable candidate for an evolutionary conserved lamin protein in this non-metazoan organism. It shares the domain organization of metazoan lamins and is fulfilling major lamin functions in Dictyostelium. Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (feSEM) images of NE81 expressed on Xenopus oocytes nuclei revealed filamentous structures with an overall appearance highly reminiscent to that of metazoan Xenopus lamin B2. For the classification as a lamin-like or a bona fide lamin protein, a better understanding of the supramolecular NE81 structure was necessary. Yet, NE81 carrying a large N-terminal GFP-tag turned out as unsuitable source for protein isolation and characterization; GFP-NE81 expressed in Dictyostelium NE81 knock-out cells exhibited an abnormal distribution, which is an indicator for an inaccurate assembly of GFP-tagged NE81.

Unexplored drivers of plant phenology : beyond climate ¤ Plant phenology is regarded as the integrative measure of plant response to environmental changes and also plays an important role in influencing the climate through altering ecosystem structure and functioning (Richardson et al. 2013). However, how the different drivers especially the environmental factors beyond climate and biotic factors influence the phenology is still not revealed. This is particularly challenging in the tree-grass ecosystems in drylands as they have a complex structure and changing the limiting resources throughout the year (Sardans and Peñuelas 2013, Nair et al. 2019). A better understanding of the relationship between drivers and phenology or dynamics of canopy development and functioning is critical importance for us to better predict the land carbon dynamics in the drylands, which is the most important contributor to the trend and interannual variability of global carbon uptake (Ahlstrom et al., 2015; Poulter et al., 2014). By using multiple measurements (field measurements, satellite, PhenoCam, high spectral-resolution spectroradiometer measurements, and eddy covariance (EC) data), we studied the relationship between the canopy structure development (used vegetation indexes (VIs) as the proxies) and functioning dynamics (e.g.dynamics of carbon and water fluxes), and the response of their seasonality metrics to different drivers in a Mediterranean tree-grass ecosystem. Through the large nutrient manipulation experiment, we investigated how nutrients and water availability co-shapes the seasonality of greenness and ecosystem functioning. By probing the spectral properties of evergreen leaves, we tested if the leaf age plays a critical role in regulating the tree canopy greenness.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127856-2>

The Horn Concept, Realization of a Form-Variable Wing Profile for Aerodynamic Performance Optimization of Future Commercial Aircraft ¤ The present work deals with the design and the realisation of a flexible trailing edge system. Goal of the flexible trailing edge system witch consists of a smooth variable cambering is the improvement of the aerodynamic performance for future airliner. The 'Hornconcept' is introduced. Several of hornlike shaped structures are rotatable mounted at a rigid leading edge box of the flap structure. The hornlike structures are covered with a flexible skin structure. The upper and lower skin is connected with flexible webs which gives stiffness in spanwise direction. By turning the horns, the skin structure is forced to adapt the form of the shape of the horns. The main characteristic of the concept is the simple and robust design, the small number of moveable parts and the low necessary actuator forces. The functionality of the concept is shown with the outer flap of the A340 as a reference system. The structural behaviour (stiffness and stress) of the different components is analysed. An actuator system is selected and designed where only two actuators are necessary. The coupling of the individual horns is made with elastic rods. It is shown that such an actuator system fulfils all requirements. With the construction of a demonstrator the practical functionality is analysed. For the manufacturing of the hornlike structures with carbon fiber a special manufacturing process is developed and tested. The process is used for the assembly of the demonstrator. With lifecycle tests the stability of the structure is proved. A finite element model of the whole system with the interacting of horn structure and skin is developed. With this model and with the results of experimental analysis an optimum configuration is found by observance the stiffness requirements. It can be shown that in all load cases the stresses for the structural components are in the limits and the functionality of the concept is kept.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190146-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128805-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164540-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4416089-6>

Inducing predefined nonlinear rogue waves on basis of breather solutions ¤ BEGIN: The Peregrine Breather, an analytical solution of the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation, is modified to induce locally and temporally accurate, predefined extreme wave events in an arbitrary directed sea state. To this end, a parameter study of the distortion term of the unstable Peregrine modulation is performed to enforce form, height, and steepness of the rogue wave. In addition, the phase modulation is identified to be the crucial perturbation for the nonlinear Breather dynamic. With this knowledge, the inducing of a predefined rogue wave in non-uniform carrier waves and even in irregular, directed sea states is presented, its limits determined, and the Breather dynamics analyzed by spectral and phase evolution analysis in time and space. The results are compared to the dynamics of real occurred extreme waves and a reverse engineering as well as a forecast model for nonlinear real rogue waves are depicted briefly.

Colored glasses and glazes from the European bronze age to the early modern : technological developments of glass processing in four examples ¤ The present study focuses on technological developments in the history of glass technology. I selected four aspects of glass manufacture from different periods, beginning in the earliest period of artificial glass and ending in the Early Modern time. The technology of glass manufacture was investigated by analysis of archaeological glass samples and the reproduction of used materials. The experimental approach enabled a detailed understanding of the challenges and specifications during the manufacture. In a first study, the formation of potential borosilicate layers on Mycenaean LBA relief fragments, that have been found close to gold sheet, were studied. We could demonstrate by infrared reflection spectroscopy that both borate contamination on gold and borax powder interact with the glass surface at temperatures above 800 ◦C. I suggested three mechanisms for potential borate contamination, that is by alteration of the gold sheet, the glass surface or the usage borax as a solder. The second study analyses the opacification process of Roman mosaic tesserae by the calcium antimonates CaSb2O6 and Ca2Sb2O7, and demonstrates that the in-situ crystallization at temperatures below 1200 ◦C produces the most reliable opacification. We reproduced the process in an experimental archaeological glass furnace at temperatures around 1050 ◦C. In a third study, I analyzed a selection of a Medieval glass feature from Münster, Germany, by X-ray fluorescence and optical spectroscopy. I demonstrate that the glass samples were made by at least three recipes. The fourth study focuses on the scattering properties of Cu2O and Cu0 particles with different sizes. I show by simulation of the Mie backscattering and absorption cross sections, how the optical spectra change depending on the particle size and the wavelength of light. Comparison with two late medieval / early modern sample sets from Glashütten, Germany and Wieda, Germany and fitting the backscattering curves into the UV/Vis/NIR reflectance spectra yielded an average Cu0 particle radius of 60 nm to 95 nm. The results were confirmed by SEM microscopy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157441-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146360-2>
On the assessment of surface urban heat island: size, urban form, and seasonality ¤ To what extent cities can be made sustainable under the mega-trends of urbanization and climate change remains a matter of unresolved scientific debate. Our inability in answering this question lies partly in the deficient knowledge regarding pivotal human-environment interactions. Regarded as the most well documented anthropogenic climate modification, the urban heat island (UHI) effect – the warmth of urban areas relative to the rural hinterland – has raised great public health concerns globally. Worse still, heat waves are being observed and are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity, which further impairs the well-being of urban dwellers. Albeit with a substantial increase in the number of publications on UHI in the recent decades, the diverse urban-rural definitions applied in previous studies have remarkably hampered the general comparability of results achieved. In addition, few studies have attempted to synergize the land use data and thermal remote sensing to systematically assess UHI and its contributing factors. In this context, it is our goal to investigate the UHI effect in various urban areas and to identify the underlying factors that influence the heat island.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306988-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0>
Plastic as a Legal Problem ¤ Plastic waste is one of the biggest ecological challenges facing the world and its inhabitants today. Kathleen S. Feurich investigates legal instruments for dealing with this problem at a national, European and international level. Picking up on recent issues, she develops concrete proposals for reform. Plastic waste poses one of the greatest ecological challenges for humans, animals, and the climate today. Effective legal control instruments are indispensable for preventing plastic waste. Kathleen S. Feurich examines existing and possible additional instruments for dealing with plastic waste in the multi-level system. Current topics such as a possible international plastic convention, the EU directive on reducing the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, a national plastic bag ban, a municipal packaging tax, and initiatives regarding coffee-to-go cups are addressed. She develops regulation proposals for better reduction of plastic waste and develops a differentiated, staged catalog of measures (instrument bundle) in the multi-level system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126336-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186812-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194123-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166051-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203674-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061644-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4391015-4>
Design of liquid crystal dimers and trimers : synthesis and characterization of novel systems containing bent-core and calamitic mesogenic units ¤ Liquid crystal oligomers are shown to be model compounds for semi-flexible main chain LC polymers, and are a subject of topical interest due to their mesomorphic behaviour, which can differ greatly from that found for the corresponding low molar mass LCs. The aim of the research described in this thesis is to design, synthesize and characterize novel mesogenic dimers and trimers in which at least one mesogenic unit possesses a banana-shaped (bent-core) mesogen whereas the other is a calamitic moiety of different size. These compounds are suitable materials for studying the boundary between bent-core and calamitic compounds, which is shown by the existence of phase sequences combining nematic and/or SmA phases (characteristic for classical calamitic mesogens) with polar columnar and/or polar smectic phases (typical for bent-core mesogens). Numerous variations on the structure of the bent-core moiety and calamitic mesogenic units, the length and parity of the flexible spacer connecting the different mesogenic units, the nature of linking groups between the mesogenic units, as well as the fashion of linking the units were conducted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071279-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1>
A Method for Efficient and Verifiable Program Annotation for the Transport of Escape Information ¤ JIT compilation is frequently employed in order to speedup the execution of platform-independent and dynamically extensible mobile code applications. Since the time required for dynamic compilation directly influences a program's execution time, JIT compilers usually utilize only simple and fast techniques for program analysis and optimization. Program annotations can be used to improve the analysis and optimizitation process of a JIT compiler. Program annotations allow a mobile code system derive information about a program, on the producer side, and transmit that information along with the program to the consumer side. In this work, we present an inherently safe annotation technique for the safe transmission of escape information. The annotation technique described in this work is built on the SafeTSA mobile code format and is implemented as a simple extension of SafeTSA's type system. The space required for these annotations is minimal, and measurements of compilation time show that using information from an offline escape analysis in form of program annotations is evident faster than performing the escape analysis at runtime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151072-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5>
Diphosphat Activation in Proteins: Considerations from Various Perspectives ¤ diphosphate activation; glycosyl transferase; glycosidase; prenyl diphosphate converting enzyme; dihydropteroate synthase; X-Ray structure; enzyme substrate interaction; quantum mechanics; clustering Diphosphat activation is a process in which, upon the removal of a diphosphate residue from an organic substrate, this is activated and thus made accessible for nucleophilic attacks. The importance and diversity of such biosynthesized enzyme products are enormous: they range from essential oils over hormones and reserve substances to pharmacologically interesting compounds, such as antibiotics or chemotherapeutics. Systematic analyses of over 400 diphosphate binding sites are intended to – accompanied by quantum chemical calculations – contribute to the clarification of activation-relevant factors. In particular, attention is paid to the diphosphate recognition and conformation in the binding pocket as well as to kinetic aspects of the activation process. The gained insights can in the future help to optimize synthetically produced, diphosphate-activating compounds and thus facilitate the currently still somewhat difficult access to pharmacologically relevant substances.

User-centered semantic dataset retrieval ¤ Finding relevant research data is an increasingly important but time-consuming task in daily research practice. Several studies report on difficulties in dataset search, e.g., scholars retrieve only partial pertinent data, and important information can not be displayed in the user interface. Overcoming these problems has motivated a number of research efforts in computer science, such as text mining and semantic search. In particular, the emergence of the Semantic Web opens a variety of novel research perspectives. Motivated by these challenges, the overall aim of this work is to analyze the current obstacles in dataset search and to propose and develop a novel semantic dataset search. The studied domain is biodiversity research, a domain that explores the diversity of life, habitats and ecosystems. This thesis has three main contributions: (1) We evaluate the current situation in dataset search in a user study, and we compare a semantic search with a classical keyword search to explore the suitability of semantic web technologies for dataset search. (2) We generate a question corpus and develop an information model to figure out on what scientific topics scholars in biodiversity research are interested in. Moreover, we also analyze the gap between current metadata and scholarly search interests, and we explore whether metadata and user interests match. (3) We propose and develop an improved dataset search based on three components: (A) a text mining pipeline, enriching metadata and queries with semantic categories and URIs, (B) a retrieval component with a semantic index over categories and URIs and (C) a user interface that enables a search within categories and a search including further hierarchical relations. Following user centered design principles, we ensure user involvement in various user studies during the development process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728093-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4410512-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005541-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566641-6>
Characterisation of microglia-specific Tgfbr2, Smad4 and Tgfb1 knockout mice ¤ Abstract: This thesis was conducted to describe the role of TGFβ mediated regulation of microglia homeostasis and activation. To this aim, I generated and characterised microglia-specific knockout mouse lines to analyse the importance of R-SMAD-dependent (mgTgfbr2-/-) and Co-SMAD-dependent (mgSmad4-/-) TGFβ signalling in microglia. Moreover, microglia-specific deletion of Tgfb1 (mgTgfb1-/-) was induced to address the effects of microglia-derived TGFβ1. According to the current literature, this is the first study using mouse lines with microglia-specific knockout of TGFβ signalling molecules. I could show that the generated mouse lines are valid models for the microglia-specific analysis of TGFβ signalling, as demonstrated by deletion on genomic and protein levels. Importantly, functional impairment of TGFβ signalling could be detected in vitro and in vivo. The knockout mice were used to reveal that microglial TGFβ signalling is not essential for microglia survival and maintenance, as no differences were seen in microglia cell numbers in vivo. Elevated cell numbers in vitro indicated an increased proliferative activity of mgTgfbr2-/- microglia. Furthermore, mice did not show any phenotypic differences with regard to body weight or survival. Additionally, using mgSmad4-/- mice, I could show that the expression of distinct TGFβ-induced genes was dependent on SMAD4. Interestingly, TGFβ-driven nuclear translocation of R-SMADs in microglia was independent on SMAD4. I could show that knockout of microglial Tgfbr2, but not of Smad4 or Tgfb1, led to an activated microglia phenotype under physiological conditions as reflected by increased expression activation markers CD86, CD206, CD36 and MHCII. mgTgfbr2-/- microglia also showed an increase of TAK1 phosphorylation as well as CCL2 and CXCL10 secretion. In contrast, knockout of Smad4 only led to a moderate increase of TAK1 phosphorylation and secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 in vitro. I could therefore show that the effects mgTgfbr2 and mgSmad4 knockout resulted in different outcome, indicating a major role of R-SMAD-dependent signalling in the regulation of microglia activation under physiological conditions. However, distinct and partially non-overlapping effects were detected in mgSmad4-/- microglia, indicating a contribution of Co-SMAD-dependent signalling for microglia quiescence. Exogenous TGFβ1 was no longer able to attenuate IFNγ-induced upregulation of the activation markers iNos and Tnfa in Tgfbr2-/- microglia.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169148-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4301913-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4671699-3>
Statistical mechanical models for image processing ¤ This thesis introduces a solution to the problem of image restoration and feature extraction by incorporating new image models derived from statistical physics. Starting from Shannon's model of information processing, a special lattice spin Hamiltonian is used which is well suited for both source coding and for modeling information loss within the Bayesian framework. By applying a high-temperature expansion the parameter estimation problem is solved analytically using transfer-matrix methods. A Monte Carlo simulation restores the distorted image utilizing the statistical information about the source and the channel. Beyond its inherent practical usefulness the image restoration problem illustrates directly basic concepts related to information theory, statistical inference, and perception. The work is split mainly in two parts: Chapters 1 to 4 contain a summary of the problem and existing models, Chapters 5 to 7 introduce the new models and illustrate their capabilities in a variety of experiments. The conclusion can be found in Chapter 8.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006684-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127615-2>
Snowball Earth aftermath : ocean dynamics and carbon cycling under extreme greenhouse conditions ¤ Abstract: When a snowball Earth deglaciates through a very high atmospheric CO2 concentration, the resulting inflow of freshwater leads to a stably stratified ocean, and the strong greenhouse conditions drive the climate into a very warm state.

The energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays measured with the KASCADE-Grande experiment ¤ The measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is an important tool to reveal the nature of cosmic rays. In order to measure the cosmic rays up to an energy of 10**18 eV, the KASCADE experiment was extended to KASCADE-Grande. It is a ground based detector to measure extensive air showers, which are initiated by the primary particles of the cosmic radiation. In order to obtain the energy spectrum, data from December 2003 to September 2007 are analyzed by using the method of constant intensity. This method is applied to the number of charged particles in an air shower and leads to a zenith angle independent number of charged particles, which is a measure of the shower size. Simulations of air showers are then used to calibrate the shower size to the primary energy. Thus, the primary energy spectrum in the energy range of 10**16 eV to 10**18 eV is determined. In the energy region from 10**16 eV to 10**17 eV the resulting spectrum and the spectrum measured with KASCADE overlap. Both measurements are in good agreement in this energy range. Due to the extended energy range, the energy spectrum of KASCADE-Grande connects the KASCADE spectrum with the measurements of experiments like AGASA, Auger and HiRes, which measure up to the highest energies of cosmic rays.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4320702-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165371-3>
Outdoor cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris : assessment of yield influencing parameters and application as biogas substrate ¤ Microalgae offer a great potential as feedstock for a variety of high-value products and biofuels. The production of microalgae biomass requires, however, high efforts and consequentially large-scale outdoor production facilities are still a rarity today. The aim of this investigation is therefore to set-up and to operate an outdoor, high-density microalgae culture to monitor, analyse, and interpret the complex processes that unfold in the system. The research addresses important aspects including productivity and composition of microalgae cultivated outdoors and the effect of flue gas on microalgae growth. Moreover, the potential of biogas production from microalgae as a promising processing option is evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006780-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4453251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277897-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145600-2>
Whose microbiome is it? : adaptive interactions of keystone species in plant microbiomes ¤ Plant organs are colonized by diverse microbial organisms that help the plant to ensure fitness and survival in unpredictable environments. Different factors shape the microbiome of plants including the plant genotype, environmental conditions and microbe-microbe interactions. Certain highly interactive microbes were identified as keystone species in plant-associated microbial communities, i.e. species that are important for the structure and integrity of a community, regardless of its abundance in the ecosystem. Keystones in plant microbiomes could be important in structuring early colonization of plants by microorganisms and in controlling the variability of plant-associated microbiomes. The goal of this project was to evaluate the hypothesis that the plant microbiome is a combination of the microbiomes of the host and its keystones, focusing on early colonization. In this work a new amplicon sequencing pipeline was developed to investigate the leaf microbiomes of nine wild Arabidopsis thaliana population identified in Jena, Germany. We found, that their core microbiome is largely, but not completely shared with other co-habituating ground-dwelling ruderal plant species. The difference between A. thaliana bacteriomes and those of other plants depended on how variable bacteriomes were in each population, which changed between years in each population. We then tested the importance of early microbial colonization in two of the wild A. thaliana populations and one A. thaliana reference strain and identified efficient early colonizers as possible keystone species. We found, that if they influenced microbial community assembly they increased the variation of bacterial communities rather than decreasing it. To summarize, early colonizing bacteria affect the outcome of plant-to-plant variation. We hypothesize that these are bacterial keystone species that do not shape the plants microbiome in a specific way, but rather serve as cues leading to more variability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259663-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169816-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045539-7>
Regulation and Liberalization of Postal Services in the Federal Republic of Germany ¤ This book provides an overview of the current national and European regulatory framework in the postal sector, its political and economic background as well as the development of its regulation until today. It focuses on competition law implications caused by the monopoly of the state-owned postal service operator, which has dominated the market for centuries, against the backdrop of efforts to liberalise, privatise and thereby open the market to other postal delivery companies. Subsequently, the author examines this regulatory framework in terms of the newest legal and economic developments within the postal sector, taking contemporary requirements into account. As a result of this examination, he establishes what reform is needed in the light of the ever-changing legal requirements and market conditions. In this context and taking into account efforts to establish equitable competition, the author concludes that the current regulatory framework has to be not only maintained but also partially intensified, whereas at the same time the competence of the regulatory authority, i.e. the Federal Network Agency, has to be expanded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046886-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120670-8>
Servo-constraints for inversion of underactuated multibody systems ¤ Accurate inverse models are essential for the control of underactuated multibody systems. The servo-constraints approach is applied here, which formulates the inverse model problem as a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). These DAEs have different properties depending on the system type. In this work, the servo-constraints approach is analyzed for all three possible system types. For differentially flat systems, experimental results demonstrate the real-time capabilities of the approach. For minimum phase systems, various integration methods are compared with respect to efficiency and accuracy. For non-minimum phase systems, a simplification of stable inversion is proposed and an output redefinition strategy is introduced for flexible bodies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038390-8>

Effect of impurities on kinetic transport processes in fusion plasmas ¤ Impurity ions pose a potentially serious threat to fusion plasma performance by affecting the confinement in various, usually deleterious, ways. Due to the creation of helium ash during fusion reactions and the interaction of the plasma with the wall components, which makes it possible for heavy ions to penetrate into the core plasma, impurities can intrinsically not be avoided. Therefore, it is essential to study their behaviour in the fusion plasma in detail. Within the framework of this thesis, different problems arising in connection with impurities have been investigated. 1. Collisional damping of zonal flows in tokamkas: The effect of impurities on the collisional damping of zonal flows is investigated. Since the Coulomb collision frequency increases with increasing ion charge, heavy, highly charged impurities play an important role in this process. The effect of such impurities on the linear response of the plasma to an external potential perturbation, as caused by zonal flows, is calculated with analytical methods and compared with numerical simulations, resulting in good agreement. 2. Impurity transport driven by microturbulence in tokamaks: Fine scale turbulence driven by microinstabilities is a source of particle and heat transport in a fusion reactor. A semi-analytical model is presented describing the resulting impurity fluxes and the stability boundary of the underlying mode ...

Multi-species Systems in Optical Lattices : From Orbital Physics in Excited Bands to Effects of Disorder ¤ BEGIN: Introduction -- Optical Lattices, Excited Bands and All That -- General Properties of the Bosonic System in the p and in the d Bands -- Conﬁned p-Orbital Bosons -- Beyond the Mean-ﬁeld Approximation: Eﬀective Pseudospin Hamiltonians Via Exchange Interaction -- Eﬀects of Disorder in Multi-species Systems. This highly interdisciplinary thesis covers a wide range of topics relating to the interface of cold atoms, quantum simulation, quantum magnetism and disorder. With a self-contained presentation, it provides a broad overview of the rapidly evolving area of cold atoms and is of interest to both undergraduates and researchers working in the field. Starting with a general introduction to the physics of cold atoms and optical lattices, it extends the theory to that of systems with different multispecies atoms. It advances the theory of many-body quantum systems in excited bands (of optical lattices) through an extensive study of the properties of both the mean-field and strongly correlated regimes. Particular emphasis is given to the context of quantum simulation, where as shown here, the orbital degree of freedom in excited bands allows the study of exotic models of magnetism not easily achievable with the previous alternative systems. In addition, it proposes a new model Hamiltonian that serves as a quantum simulator of various disordered systems in different symmetry classes that can easily be reproduced experimentally. This is of great interest, especially for the study of disorder in 2D quantum systems. . ENDE	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122915-0>
Ion-nanostructure interaction : comparing simulation and experiment towards surface structuring using nanoparticles ¤ Nanotechnology is a buzzword in context of the proceeding miniaturization of devices and their components. Nanoparticles (NPs) can nowadays easily be synthesized from different material compositions by different chemical and physical processes. However, most of these techniques work close to or at the thermal equilibrium. One subsequent approach to tune materials beyond equilibrium conditions is ion beam irradiation. An important effect of this approach is sputtering. Sputtering is enhanced in NPs compared to their bulk counterparts due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, especially when the ion range matches the NP size. In this work, the sputtering effects of Ar+ and Ga+ ion irradiated Au nanoparticles are investigated in detail by Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a variety of experiments. The sputtering of Ar+ and Ga+ irradiated Au NPs was investigated as a function of ion energy, NP size and impact parameter by the MC code iradina and MD code parcas. The simulation results are directly compared to experiments using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of Au NPs on top of Si, whereat the sputter yields are significantly enhanced compared to the MC simulations. Additionally, the interaction of NPs and substrate were investigated by Rutherford backscatter spectrometry (RBS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A new MC code was developed to study the redeposition of sputtered atoms of Ga+ irradiated Au NP arrays on neighboring NPs. The redeposition can lead to growth of NPs with diameters of 1 nm in vicinity of ~50 nm NP. These simulations are directly compared to an in situ experiment. Nanostructures, spherical NPs as well as nanowires (NWs) are used as irradiation masks to structure lithium niobate (LNO) using the ion beam enhanced etching (IBEE) technique. The aspect ratio of the obtained structures can be enhanced by a second IBEE step after annealing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027606-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8>

Bifurcation analysis of microscopic follow-the-leader traffic models ¤ Traffic flow is an interesting phenomenon of our modern world. Although we all experience it daily, traffic flow is far from being well understood. It is a life science problem, since drivers do not usually act according to well defined rules. However, the increase of traffic in many areas and the related problems underline the importance of a realistic description of traffic flow or of some of its features. The mathematical modeling of traffic flow has a long tradition. Various approaches can be found in literature. A very common class of traffic models is the macroscopic one, where the traffic flow is described in terms of density and velocity distributions ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7531433-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160648-6>
