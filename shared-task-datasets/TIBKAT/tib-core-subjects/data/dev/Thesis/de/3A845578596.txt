Wetlands are often considered as wastelands as they cannot be used as regular farmlands, for which they are usually drained to turn them into agricultural land. Such a limited perspective on wetlands overlooks the multiple ecosystem services that wetlands provide for humans and nature. Some of those services are the storage and purification of water, provision of food and raw materials, regulation of local climate and using as a habitat. Many of such services are provided by nature for ’free’ and therefore have no monetary value on traditional markets. In the case of China, wetlands cover 8% of the total area but are in a serious threatening situation through there is some success in restoring parts of them in recent years. In the last 50 years more than 20% of Chinese wetlands got lost due to pollution, water diversion and dams, reclamation, drainage and over-exploitation resouces. Water resources and wetlands −especially in North and North-East of China, are under pressure as these are arid or semi-arid regions. Yet, wetlands provide important ecosystem services for aforementioned region and contribute significantly to local livelihood in many ways, for instance the provision of food and raw materials. The aim of this thesis was to make an assessment- in both economic and ecologic terms, of Common Reed (Phragmites australis) at Lake Wuliangsuhai, where reed can be found in large amounts and is locally relevant. Reed was investigated at a case study in Inner Mongolia, China ...
