Introduction to RF equipment and system design
Annotation "Introduction to RF Equipment and System Design offers a comprehensive overview of the most important aspects and components of radio frequency equipment and systems. The book applies theoretical fundamentals to real-world issues, extensively using examples from recent design projects. An excellent resource for engineers and engineering students alike, this practical design guide shows readers how to: configure effective receiver and transmitter architectures from commercial blocks; determine the most efficient ways of circumventing wave propagation problems in a real network; assemble a reliable test environment for an RF project; make a design survive in the real operating environment; and design a small instrumentation radar system and an airborne telemetry system."--BOOK JACKET.
