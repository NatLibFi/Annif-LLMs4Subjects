Graphene : fundamentals, devices, and applications
Graphene is the first two-dimensional material. Its remarkable physical properties have made it an important growth area in contemporary research and the basis for new nanoelectronic applications. This book focuses on the practical applications enabled by graphene's unique properties. It covers the mechanisms of electric and thermal transport in the gated graphene, interface phenomena, quantum dots, non-equilibrium states, scattering and dissipation, and coherent transport in graphene junctions. This book is targeted at a wide audience, including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, researchers, and industrial engineers.
