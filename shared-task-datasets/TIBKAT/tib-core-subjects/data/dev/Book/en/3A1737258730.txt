Off the grid : art practices and public space
"Looking at three historically distinct conjunctures of artistic practice, this book claims public space for renegotiating art and community, art and politics, art and economy. This book investigates the changing relations between art practice and public space, between art and community, and between art and resistance in the Americas in the 1920s, 1960s, and the contemporary period. The book explores new visions of culture, community, and public space in the U.S. and Latin America as they have emerged from artistic practice in public sites"--
