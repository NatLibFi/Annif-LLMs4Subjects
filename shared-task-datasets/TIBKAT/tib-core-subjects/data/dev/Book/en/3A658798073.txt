Materials challenges : inorganic photovoltaic solar energy
"Materials challenges: Inorganic Photovoltaic Solar Cells provides an authoritative reference on the various aspects of materials science that will impact the next generation of photovoltaic (PV) module technology.  The materials emphasis will bring a fresh perspective to the literature and will highlight the many issues that are often buried in other texts where the solution to materials challenges can be crucial in developing a new PV technology.  The emphasis of the book will be on the range of thin film PV materials.  Thin film PV is growing more rapidly than crystalline silicon and although only 15% of the current market it could dominate in the longer term.  This book addresses the fundamental aspects of PV solar cell materials and gives a comprehensive description of each of the major thin films materials either in research or in production.  Particular attention will be given to the key materials drivers of solar conversion efficiency, long-term stability, material costs and material sustainability"--Back cover
