The latent world of architecture : selected essays
"This book features thirteen essays by the late architect, philosopher and teacher Dalibor Vesely (1934-2015). Vesely was a leading authority on philosophical hermeneutics and phenomenology in relation to architecture worldwide, and influenced a generation of thinkers, teachers and practitioners. This collection presents the full range of his writing, drawing primarily from the history of art and architecture, as well as philosophy, theology, anthropology and ecology, and spanning from early antiquity to modernism. It composes a multifaceted and globally relevant argument about the enduring cultural role of architecture and the significance of its history. The book, edited and introduced by Vesely's teaching partner at Cambridge Peter Carl and former student Alexandra Stara, brings to light new and hard-to-access material for those familiar with Vesely's thought, and, at the same time, offers a compelling introduction to his writing and its profound relevance for architecture and culture today"--
