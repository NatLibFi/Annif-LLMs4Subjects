Nanophytopathology
"The book entitled 'Nanophytopathology' discusses the need of alternative technologies such as smart nanotechnological tools including nanobiosensor in detection of plant diseases, delivery of fungicides and therapy for the diseases caused by plant pathogens and pests. The use of nanomaterials will minimize the huge amount of application of pesticides, fungicides and fertilizers thereby reducing the environmental pollution. This technology is eco-friendly, economically viable and useful for the sustainable crop production. The book consists of the chapters written by experienced experts in respective fields, which provides up-to-date knowledge concerning the pathogen/pest control using nanotechnology. It will be an essential reading for Post-Graduate students and researchers, agriculture scientists, nanotechnologists, microbiologists, green chemistry experts, and biotechnologists"--
