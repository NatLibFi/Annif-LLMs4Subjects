Gorenstein Dimensions
This book is intended as a reference for mathematicians working with homological dimensions in commutative algebra and as an introduction to Gorenstein dimensions for graduate students with an interest in the same. Any admirer of classics like the Auslander-Buchsbaum-Serre characterization of regular rings, and the Bass and Auslander-Buchsbaum formulas for injective and projective dimension of f.g. modules will be intrigued by this book's content. Readers should be well-versed in commutative algebra and standard applications of homological methods. The framework is that of complexes, but all major results are restated for modules in traditional notation, and an appendix makes the proofs accessible for even the casual user of hyperhomological methods
