The new urban condition : criticism and theory from architecture and urbanism
"This book explores new architectural and design perspectives on the contemporary urban condition. While architects and urban designers have long maintained that their actions, drawings and buildings are 'post-critical', this book seeks to expand the critical dimension of architecture and urbanism. In a series of historical and theoretical studies, this book examines how the materialities, forms and practices of architecture and urban design can act as a critique towards the new urban condition. It not only proposes new concepts and theories, but also instruments of analysis and reflection to better understand the current counter-hegemonic tendencies in both disciplinary strategies and appropriation tactics. The diversely international selection of essays, from Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United States and the Netherlands, combine different theoretical and empirical perspectives into a new analysis of the city and architecture. Demonstrating the need for new critical urban and architectural thinking that engages with the challenges and processes of the contemporary urban condition, this volume will be a thought-provoking read for academics and students in architecture, urban design, geography, political science and more"--
