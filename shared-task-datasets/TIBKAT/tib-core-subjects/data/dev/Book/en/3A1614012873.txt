Lecture notes on regularity theory for the Navier-Stokes equations
The lecture notes in this book are based on the TCC (Taught Course Centre for graduates) course given by the author in Trinity Terms of 2009-2011 at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. It contains more or less an elementary introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations as well as the modern regularity theory for them. The latter is developed by means of the classical PDE's theory in the style that is quite typical for St Petersburg's mathematical school of the Navier-Stokes equations. The global unique solvability (well-posedness) of initial boundary value
