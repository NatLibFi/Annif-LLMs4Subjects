Biopolymer grafting : applications
Biopolymer Grafting: Applications presents the latest research and developments in the practical application of these methods in industry, both to enable polymer scientists and engineers to keep up with the latest research trends, as well as to propose ideas for further research and application. Research into bio-based polymers has become increasingly prevalent. However, due to challenges related to the properties of these materials compared to synthetic polymers--such as their resistance to chemicals or weather--uptake has not dramatically increased yet
