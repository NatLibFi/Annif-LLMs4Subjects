Handbook of research on techno-entrepreneurship : ecosystems, innovation and development
"While knowledge-intensive environments encourage and foster new ideas for products, services, production methods and business models, they also entail high levels of risk derived from the fast and dynamically changing nature of technology. This Handbook explores the new theoretical frameworks that are needed to cope with the growing relevance of techno-entrepreneurship initiatives globally. Demonstrating that techno-entrepreneurship and its ecosystems create opportunities across national borders, this Handbook also shows how they proactively shape their business environment and engage in more complex collaborative networks. Chapters cover emerging areas in the field, such as frugal innovation, the drone industry and gender-specific entrepreneurship. Separated into sections dedicated to entrepreneurial ecosystems - with original research into incubators, accelerators and crowd funding - and techno-entrepreneurship across countries, the contributors examine specific issues that arise in context. With international scope, this Handbook will be an essential read for entrepreneurship and innovation scholars. Any researcher with an interest in entrepreneurial ecosystems will also benefit from the original research presented"--
