Particle physics of brane worlds and extra dimensions
"This book provides a comprehensive account of these recent developments, keeping the high-energy physics implications in focus. After a historical survey of the idea of extra dimensions, the book deals in detail with models of large extra dimensions, warped extra dimensions and other models such as universal extra dimensions. The theoretical and phenomenological implications are discussed in a pedagogical manner for both researchers and graduate students"--
