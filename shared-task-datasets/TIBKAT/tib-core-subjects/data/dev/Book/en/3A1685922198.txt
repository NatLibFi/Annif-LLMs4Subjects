Foundations of classical mechanics
Written in easily accessible language, the book provides a modern perspective of classical mechanics. Mathematical rigour is intertwined with lucid narration that would generate confidence in students to assimilate and apply fundamental principles of physics. The commonalities and differences of Newton's, Lagrange's and Hamilton's equations are explained in detail. Free, damped, driven oscillators and resonances are analysed systematically. The text extensively covers concepts of fluid mechanics, special theory of relativity, general theory of relativity and Lorentz transformations. The theories of gravitational field, fractals and chaos, Maxwell's laws of electrodynamics, and Einstein's theory of relativity are expanded from the first principle. Supported by practice problem sets to help students check their understanding of the concepts.
