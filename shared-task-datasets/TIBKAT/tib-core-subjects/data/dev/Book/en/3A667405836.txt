Exploring quantum physics through hands-on projects
"This book allows readers to gain an intuitive understanding of the principles behind Quantum Mechanics through hands-on construction and replication of the original experiments that led to the current view of the quantum world. All of the experimental equipment can be built out of relatively inexpensive materials that are readily available. The math used in this book, simple and with clear explanations and analogies, is accessible to anyone with a knowledge of high school algebra and basic trigonometry"--Provided by publisher
