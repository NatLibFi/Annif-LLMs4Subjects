"The most common approach to adaptive optics (AO), as originally employed in astronomical telescopes, has been to use a wavefront sensor to measure directly aberrations. In situations where such sensing provides reliable measurement, this is clearly the ideal method (see Chapter 2), but this approach has limitations,and particularly so in the context of microscopy. In order to understand this, one should consider the constraints the use of a wavefront sensor places on the nature of the optical conguration. A wavefront is only well de ned in particular situations, for example when light is emitted by a small or distant, point-like object, such as a star for a telescope or a minuscule bead in a microscope. In these situations, a wavefront sensor provides a clear and reliable measurement and this phenomenon has been used to great effect, as explained in Chapter 2. However, not all sources of light have these necessary properties. For example, a large luminous object comprises an arrangement of individual emitters, each of which produces its associated wavefront. In this case, a wavefront sensor would respond to all of the light impinging upon it, thus giving potentially ambiguous measurements. In an extreme case, such as where light is emitted throughout the volume of the specimen, the sensor would be swamped with light and thus be un-able to provide sensible aberration measurement. For this reason, in microscopy, direct wavefront sensing has been e ective where point-like sources have been employed, either through the introduction of uorescent beads [1, 2], or using localised uorescent markers [3] and non-linear excited guide stars [4, 5, 6]"--Provided by publisher
