Introduction to VLSI design flow
"Chip designing is a complex task that requires an in-depth understanding of VLSI design flow, skills to employ sophisticated design tools, and keeping pace with the bleeding-edge semiconductor technologies. This lucid textbook is focused on fulfilling these requirements for students, as well as a refresher for professionals in the industry. The book consists of four parts. The first part describes foundational concepts related to VLSI design flow and integrated circuits. It also gives an overview of the design, verification, and test methods employed in a typical VLSI design flow. The second part of the book describes the logic implementation and verification steps such as simulation, static timing analysis, and formal methods. It also explains the modelling of hardware using Verilog and logic synthesis; technology libraries; and timing constraints along with logic, power, and timing optimization techniques. The third part of the book describes the design for test (DFT) methods for digital circuits. The fourth and final part describes physical design methods and physical verification. All the physical design implementation steps such as floorplanning, placement, clock-tree synthesis, and routing are described in this part. Moreover, physical verification steps, such as parasitic extraction, design rule checks (DRCs), electrical rule checks (ERCs), layout versus schematic (LVS) checks, and post-silicon validation are explained. Illustrations and pictorial representations are used liberally to simplify the explanation. Additionally, activities are suggested at the end of relevant chapters to help readers gain a practical understanding of VLSI design flow. Review questions and problems are given at the end of each chapter to revise the concepts. Recent trends and references are listed at the end of each chapter for further reading"--
