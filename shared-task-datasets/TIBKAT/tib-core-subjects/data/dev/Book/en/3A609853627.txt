Coatings for biomedical applications
"The biomaterials sector is rapidly expanding and significant advances have been made in the technology of biomedical coatings and materials, which provide a means to improve the wear of joints, change the biological interaction between implant and host and combine the properties of various materials to improve device performance. This book provides an extensive review of coating types and surface modifications for biomedical applications. The first part explores a range of coating types and their biomedical applications. Chapters look at hydrophilic, mineral and pyrolytic carbon coatings in and ex vivo orthopaedic applications and finally at surface modification and preparation techniques. Part two presents case studies of orthopaedic and ophthalmic coatings, and biomedical applications including vascular stents, cardiopulmonary by-pass equipment and ventricular assist devices"--Back cover
