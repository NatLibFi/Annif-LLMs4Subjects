Creating value through innovation
In open and dynamic markets, only innovation can give a firm a competitive advantage and with it the superior cash flows that generate value. This book offers a new conceptual structure and applicable analytical models for evaluating a firm's innovation strategies in highly competitive environments and for estimating firm value. Using analytical models, Angelo Dringoli examines the conditions under which innovation strategy can create and maintain value, based on different environmental dynamics. Quantitative models are used to determine the value of innovation strategies in highly dynamic and competitive industries. These clearly reveal the economic variables and relations upon which the strategy depends, and the conditions for creating sustainable value within the firm. This stimulating integrated analysis will appeal to researchers and postgraduate students with an interest in economics, finance and business administration, as well as managers and professionals involved in strategic management and firm evaluation
