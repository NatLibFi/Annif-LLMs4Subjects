Physics on your feet: Berkeley graduate exam questions : or ninety minutes of shame but a PhD for the rest of your life
The authors, previously students in the Physics Department of the University of California at Berkeley, present possible questions from Berkeley's former oral examination for first year graduate students. The questions are followed by answers, all done with humor, accompanied by illustrations and cartoons
