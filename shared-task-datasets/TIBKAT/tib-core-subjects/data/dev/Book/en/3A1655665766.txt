Stable nanoemulsions : self-assembly in nature and nanomedicine
Certain stable lipid nanoemulsions, existing in natural waters and certain artificial media, display - upon intravenous injection - a marked capability for rapid active targeting, both to tumors and to certain lesion sites. This category of lipid nanoemulsions contains no phospholipids, no proteins nor peptides, no carbohydrates, and no chemical modification of the lipophilic drugs is required; consequently it avoids various past problems reported for earlier versions of targeted nanoemulsions. The book covers in detail the underlying chemical and biochemical principles of stable lipid nanoemulsions as well as many current and potential applications in nanomedicine such as targeted chemotherapy. It is in harmony with goals of the current US National Nanotechnology Initiative, which include nanomedical approaches to drug delivery that focus on developing nanoscale particles to improve drug bioavailability i.e. often using targeted nanoparticles for delivering drugs with cell precision and less side effects. Despite the obvious practical importance to various fields including nanomedicine there is currently no comprehensive book available in the literature. The proposed book will effectively fill this gap. Detailed coverage of the underlying chemical and biochemical principles of stable lipid nanoemulsions. The book includes many current and potential applications in nanomedicine such as targeted chemotherapy. Contains 67 figures (including 13 microscope photos) and 26 tables Over 1200 literature references, many of them of very recent date
