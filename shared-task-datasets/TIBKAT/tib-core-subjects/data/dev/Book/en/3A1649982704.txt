Zinc Oxide : From Fundamental Properties Towards Novel Applications
This book gives a comprehensive review of the present state of the art in ZnO R+D, including growth, doping, lattice dynamics, electric magnetic and optical properties. The emphasis is on the electric and optical properties, because this is the area where novel applications may be expected with highest promise. The book highlights not only the most recent results but gives both an overview of past research and of the present status -- not avoiding critical and controversial discussions of various aspects such as bank symmetries and laser processes. Intended to have long-lasting impact on ZnO R+D, this monograph addresses (post-)graduate students but also advanced scientists, who want to embark on ZnO research or are already involved, the present state of the art and assists them in avoiding duplication of old results (or mistakes).
