"The previously published textbook Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism provides a clear, calculus-based introduction to a subject that together with classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and modern physics lies at the heart of today's physics curriculum. The lectures, although relatively concise, covers from Coulomb's law to Maxwell's equations and special relativity in a lucid and logical fashion. The book also contains an extensive set of accessible problems that enhances and extends the coverage, so the present book, as an aid to teaching and learning, provides the solutions to those problems"--
