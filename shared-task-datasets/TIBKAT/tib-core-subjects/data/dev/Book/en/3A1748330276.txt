The micro-doppler effect in radar
This highly practical resource provides you with thorough working knowledge of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, including its principles, applications and implementation with MATLAB codes. The book presents code for simulating radar backscattering from targets with various motions, generating micro-Doppler signatures, and analyzing the characteristics of targets. You find detailed descriptions of the physics and mathematics of the Doppler and micro-Doppler effect. Moreover, you learn how to derive rigid and non-rigid body motion induced micro-Doppler effect in radar scattering. The book prov
