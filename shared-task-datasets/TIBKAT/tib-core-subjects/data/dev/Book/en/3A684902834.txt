Supergravity
"Supergravity, together with string theory, is one of the most significant developments in theoretical physics. Although there are many books on string theory, this is the first-ever authoritative and systematic account of supergravity. Written by two of the most respected workers in the field, it provides a solid introduction to the fundamentals of supergravity. It starts by reviewing aspects of relativistic field theory in Minkowski spacetime. After introducing the relevant ingredients of differential geometry and gravity, some basic supergravity theories (D=4 and D=11) and the main gauge theory tools are explained. In the second half of the book, complex geometry and N=1 and N=2 supergravity theories are covered. Classical solutions and a chapter on AdS/CFT complete the book. Numerous exercises and examples make it ideal for Ph.D. students and with applications to model building, cosmology and solutions of supergravity theories, it is also invaluable to researchers"--
