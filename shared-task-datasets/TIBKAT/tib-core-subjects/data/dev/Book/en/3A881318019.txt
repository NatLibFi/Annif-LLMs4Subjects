"Optics using MATLAB provides a functional overview of developing code using MATLAB that can be used to enhance and increase understanding optics topics though the use of visualization tools. The book ties a number of optical topics to programming activities with MATLAB and can act as a supplement to other textbooks or stand alone. It is divided into three sections. Part I focuses on a wide range of basic programing fundamentals using MATLAB and includes topics such as curve fitting, image processing, and file storage. Part II provides a review of a number of selected topics in optics and demonstrates how these can be explored using MATLAB scripts. Part III discusses how to use MATLAB to improve the usability of custom programs through graphical user interfaces and incorporating other programming languages. Optical engineers needing flexibility and special calculations will find the books explanations and examples of user-programmable software to be of value"--
