Transcendental representations with applications to solids and fluids
"Unifying applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, this book looks at how generalized functions are used in physics and engineering applications. It provides a comprehensive overview of numerous mathematical models in generalized functions with many applications to solids and fluids that are particularly relevant in aerospace and mechanical engineering. The author, one of Europe's leading applied mathematicians, presents the laws of physics to formulate problems, mathematical methods to solve them, and examples of the interpretation of results. Provides mathematical models of physical phenomena and engineering processes. Emphasizes interdisciplinary topics by combining several areas of physics, mathematics, and engineering. Explores the interplay between physical laws and mathematical methods as a basis for modeling natural phenomena and engineering devices. Includes examples and applications with interpretation of results and discussion of assumptions and their consequences. Enables readers to construct mathematical-physical models suited to new observations or novel engineering devices. Contains problems with solutions that explain the answers step by step"--
