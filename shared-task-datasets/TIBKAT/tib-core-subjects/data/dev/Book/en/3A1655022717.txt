This book of tables includes a reduced representative of each class of. integral positive definite primitive quaternary quadratic forms through discriminant 1732. The classes are grouped into genera; also included are Hasse symbols, the number of automorphs and the level of each such form, and the mass of each genus. An appendix lists p-adic densities and p-adic Jordan splittings for each genus in the tables for p = 2 and for each odd prime p dividing the discriminant. The book is divided into several sections. The first, an introductory section, contains background material, an explanation of the techniques used to generate the information contained in the tables, a description of the format of the tables, some instructions for computer use, examples, and references. The next section contains a printed version of the tables through discriminant 500, included to allow the reader to peruse at least this much without the inconvenience of making his/her own hard copy via the computer. Because of their special interest, we include tables of discriminants 729 and 1729 at the end of this section. Limitations of space preclude publication of more than this in printed form. A printed appendix through discriminant 500 and for discriminants 729 and 1729 follows. The complete tables and appendix through discriminant 1732 are compressed onto the accompanying 3.5 inch disk, formatted for use in a PC-compatible computer and ready for research use particularly when uploaded to a mainframe. Documentation is included in the Introduction.
