This textbook addresses imaging from the system engineering point of view, examining advantages and disadvantages of imaging in various spectral regions. Focuses on imaging principles and system concepts, rather than devices. Intended as a senior-year undergraduate or graduate level engineering textbook. A solution manual is included
