Determination of metals in natural waters, sediments, and soils
"A review of the most up-to-date techniques for determinations of metals in natural waters and riverine sediments: Includes all of the methods currently available to assess metals in water, sediments and soils -- Covers metals in surface groundwater as well as mineral waters -- Summarizes the strengths, weakness and precautions of different methods and includes a table summarizing the methods with reference citations. ... provides a completely up-to-date, analytic overview of the various methods available for examining metals, and serves as a manual to determine metal concentrations in different media such as natural waters, wastewaters, sediments and soils. The book begins with a discussion of sampling techniques and preservation, and then covers metals in rivers, surface groundwater, and mineral waters, as well as metals in aqueous precipitation. It concludes with detailed information on how to analyze metals in sediments. With its coverage of various procedures and techniques to be used in a variety of situations, [this book] provides a solid foundation for informed action to be taken by environmental interest groups and regulators and a starting point for further study by graduate students, professionals, and researchers."--Back cover
