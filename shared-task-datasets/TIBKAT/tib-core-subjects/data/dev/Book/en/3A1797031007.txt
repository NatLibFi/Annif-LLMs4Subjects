Introduction to linear algebra : computation, application, and theory
"Introduction to Linear Algebra: Computation, Application, and Theory is designed for students who have never been exposed to the topics in a linear algebra course. The text is filled with interesting and diverse application sections but is also a theoretical text which aims to train students to do succinct computation in a knowledgeable way. After completing the course with this text, the student will not only know the best and shortest way to do linear algebraic computations but will also know why such computations are both effective and successful. Features  Includes cutting edge applications in machine learning and data analytics  Suitable as a primary text for undergraduates studying linear algebra  Requires very little in the way of pre-requisites"--
