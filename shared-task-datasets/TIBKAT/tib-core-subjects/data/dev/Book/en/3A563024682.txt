Energy security and climate policy : assessing interactions
World energy demand is surging. Oil, coal and natural gas still meet most global energy needs, creating serious implications for the environment. One result is that CO 2 emissions, the principal cause of global warming, are rising. &nbsp;. This new study underlines the close link between efforts to ensure energy security and those to mitigate climate change. Decisions on one side affect the other. To optimise the efficiency of their energy policy, OECD countries must consider energy security and climate change mitigation priorities jointly. &nbsp;. The book presents a framework to assess inter
