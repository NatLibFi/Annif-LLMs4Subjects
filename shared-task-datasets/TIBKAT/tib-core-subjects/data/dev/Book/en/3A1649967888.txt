Smart Hydrogel Modelling
This is the first monograph of its kind, where a comprehensive and systematic description of modeling and simulation of the smart polymer hydrogels in BioMEMS environment is provided. It will cover the development of the models in form of nonlinear coupled partial differential governing equations for the smart hydrogels. Further, benchmark results, for simulation and prediction of responsive behaviour of the smart hydrogels to solution pH, externally applied electric voltage, environmental temperature, glucose/carbohydrates and salt concentration/ionic strength that are basic stimuli in common BioMEMS devices, are also documented. Finally, it is written in as simple a manner as possible, such that it will make informative and easy reading for the expert, and concurrently it can serve as a rich reference source for a graduate student intending to work in this area.
