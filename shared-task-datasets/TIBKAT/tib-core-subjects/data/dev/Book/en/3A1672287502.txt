Speckle phenomena in optics : theory and applications
"Speckle, a granular structure appearing in images and diffraction patterns produced by objects that are rough on the scale of an optical wavelength, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, appearing in optics, acoustics, microwaves, and other fields. This book provides comprehensive coverage of this subject, both the underlying statistical theory and the applications of this phenomenon. This is a second edition, containing improvements of several sections and addition of significant amounts of new material. New material includes new sections on generalized random walks, a rewritten section on speckle in the eye, new sections on polarization speckle, including discussion of the statistics of the Stokes parameters in a speckle pattern, new discussions of the effects of angle and wavelength changes on speckle, new sections on the statistics of speckle from "smooth" surfaces, and a new section on a spectrometer based on speckle. Many new references are included. As with the first edition, a multitude of areas of application are covered"--
