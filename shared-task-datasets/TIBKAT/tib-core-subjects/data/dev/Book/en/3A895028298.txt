Thorvald Bindesbøll - inventing modernism
Thorvald Bindesbøll (1846-1908) was one of the first modern designers in Denmark. His activities covered all the different areas of decorative art: from furniture, book covers, jewellery, carpets, lamps, posters and the familiar Carlsberg beer label to church interiors and sepulchral monuments. His architecture bridges the 19th and the 20th centuries. He is best known for his ceramics, however, with which he created a nonfigurative, abstract art, decades before the emergence of the concept.0
