Differential Equations of My Young Years
Vladimir Maz'ya (born 1937) is an outstanding mathematician who systematically made fundamental contributions to a wide array of areas in mathematical analysis and in the theory of partial differential equations. In this fascinating book he describes the first thirty years of his life in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). He starts with the story of his family, speaks about his childhood, the high school and university years, and recalls his formative years as a mathematician. Behind the author's personal recollections, with his own joys, sorrows and hopes, one sees a vivid picture of those times in the former Sovjet Union. He speaks warmly about his friends, both outside and inside the world of mathematics, about discovering his passion for mathematics and his early achievements, and about a number of mathematicians who influenced his professional life. The book is written in a highly readable and inviting style, spiced with the occasional touch of humor
