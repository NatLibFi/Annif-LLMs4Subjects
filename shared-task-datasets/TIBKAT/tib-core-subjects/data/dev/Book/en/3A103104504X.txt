Sustainable approaches to urban transport
"As cities become increasingly congested current transport patterns are unsustainable: heavy in energy use, high in economic and environmental cost, and exacerbating inequity between those who can access high speed travel and those who cannot. Good urban planning develops human-scale cities and encourages modes such as bicycles, increased zones exclusive to pedestrians within the cities, and changed fiscal policies to incentivise public over private transport. Equally, it requires good engineering design to manage road use. This book brings together contributions from leading international experts in urban planning, transport and governance who suggest changes to make our cities more sustainable in the face of climate change. All professionals working in transport and engineering and planning students will find an overview of a broad field in this interdisciplinary collection of essays."--Provided by publisher
