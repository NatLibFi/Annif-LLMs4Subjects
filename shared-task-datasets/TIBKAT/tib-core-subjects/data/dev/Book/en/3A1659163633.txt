On Ancient Grammars of Space : Linguistic Research on the Expression of Spatial Relations and Motion in Ancient Languages
This volume presents new research by the TOPOI group "Spaces in Language" on the expression of spatial relations in ancient languages. The six articles in this volume discuss static and dynamic aspects of the spatial grammars of Ancient to Medieval Greek, Akkadian, Hittite, and Ancient Egyptian, as well as field data on eight modern languages. All ancient language data are fully explained in linguistic glosses.
