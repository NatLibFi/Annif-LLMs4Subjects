Modelling, Analysis, and Design of Hybrid Systems
This volume summarizes the results of a priority program launched by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) called KONDISK-Dynamics and Control of Systems with Mixed Continuous and Discrete Dynamics. The program was motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to hybrid systems both in the computer science and the control engineering communities. Technical systems nowadays are composed of physical components with mostly continuous dynamics and computerized control systems where the reaction to discrete events plays a major role, implemented in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Distributed Control Systems (DCSs) or real-time computer systems. Several practical examples of systems with mixed continuous-discrete dynamics are presented, such as a conveyor belt, an annealing furnace, a membranous filtration process, a titration plant, a diesel engine, robotic arms, a chemical reactor, tank systems, or an aircraft elevator system
