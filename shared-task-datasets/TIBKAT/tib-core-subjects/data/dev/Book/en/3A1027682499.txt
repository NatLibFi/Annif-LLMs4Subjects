Differential equations for engineers and scientists
This concise applications-oriented text is intended for undergraduate students in engineering, mathematics, and other areas of science. The first chapters focus on solutions of first order equations, linear equations with constant coefficients, and simultaneous equations and reducible equations. Subsequent chapters explore the method of solution by infinite series and the more important special functions of mathematical physics. The treatment examines the solution of partial differential equations as well as numerical methods of solution, including that of relaxation. Readers also receive an introduction to the theory of nonlinear differential equations. Nearly 900 worked examples and exercises include complete solutions, making this volume ideal for self-study as well as an excellent classroom text
