Lectures on Seiberg-Witten Invariants
This book gives a streamlined introduction to the theory of Seiberg-Witten invariants suitable for second-year graduate students. These invariants can be used to prove that there are many compact topological four-manifolds which have more than one smooth structure, and that others have no smooth structure at all. This topic provides an excellent example of how global analysis techniques, which have been developed to study nonlinear partial differential equations, can be applied to the solution of interesting geometrical problems. In the second edition, some material has been expanded for better comprehension
