Chaotic Systems with Multistability and Hidden Attractors
Introduction -- Šil’nikov Theorem -- Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria -- Chaotic Systems without Equilibria -- Chaotic Systems with Curves of Equilibria -- Chaotic Systems with Surfaces of Equilibria -- Chaotic Systems with Any Number and Various Types of Equilibria -- Hyperchaotic Systems with Hidden Attractors.
This book presents a collection of new articles written by world-leading experts and active researchers to present their recent finding and progress in the new area of chaotic systems and dynamics, regarding emerging subjects of unconventional chaotic systems and their complex dynamics.It guide readers directly to the research front of the new scientific studies. This book is unique of its kind in the current literature, presenting broad scientific research topics including multistability and hidden attractors in unconventional chaotic systems, such as chaotic systems without equilibria, with only stable equilibria, with a curve or a surface of equilibria. The book describes many novel phenomena observed from chaotic systems, such as non-Shilnikov type chaos, coexistence of different types of attractors, and spontaneous symmetry breaking in chaotic systems. The book presents state-of-the-art scientific research progress in the field with both theoretical advances and potential applications. This book is suitable for all researchers and professionals in the areas of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems, including research professionals, physicists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists and, in particular, graduate students in related fields.
