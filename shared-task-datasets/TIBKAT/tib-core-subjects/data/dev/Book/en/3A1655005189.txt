Magic Graphs
This book is a good guide for graduate students beginning research in graph labelings. They can see how new mathematics comes into existence. … Throughout the text there are exercises and research problems. … Some are quite easy, some ask the reader to do a complete search for labelings of a particular graph or labelings of a particular type, a few are quite difficult. … The book is a beautiful collection of recent results on the topic of “magic labelings”. -Mathematical Reviews (Review of First Edition) The introductory chapter covers briefly the basics of graph theory and introduces various kinds of magic labelings of graphs. The main three chapters that follow are devoted to the three main types of magic labelings: edge-magic, vertex-magic, and totally magic labellings, respectively. … Not many mathematical prerequisites are needed to read this book although the reader should have some mathematical maturity. -Zentralblatt MATH (Review of First Edition) Magic squares are among the more popular mathematical recreations. Over the last 50 years, many generalizations of “magic” ideas have been applied to graphs. Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in “magic labelings” due to a number of results that have applications to the problem of decomposing graphs into trees. Key features of this second edition include: ·         a new chapter on magic labeling of directed graphs ·         applications of theorems from graph theory and interesting counting arguments ·         new research problems and exercises covering a range of difficulties ·         a fully updated bibliography and index This concise, self-contained exposition is unique in its focus on the theory of magic graphs/labelings. It may serve as a graduate or advanced undergraduate text for courses in mathematics or computer science, and as reference for the researcher
