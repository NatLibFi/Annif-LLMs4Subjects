Nanotechnology for smart concrete
"Nanomaterials have been shown to markedly improve the mechanical properties of concrete, as well as to reduce the porosity and enhance the durability of concrete. Nanotechnology for Smart Concrete discusses the advantages and applications of nanomaterials in concrete including high-strength performance, microstructural improvement, self-healing, energy storage, and coatings. It analyzes the linkage of concrete materials with nanomaterials and nanostructures. It also discusses applications of nanomaterials in the concrete industry, including energy storage in green buildings, anti-corrosive coatings, and inhibiting pathogens and viruses"
