Artificial intelligence and modeling for water sustainability : global challenges
"Artificial intelligence and the use of computational methods to extract information from data are providing adequate tools to monitor and predict water pollutants and water quality issues faster and more accurately. Smart sensors and machine learning models help detect and monitor dispersion and leakage of pollutants before they reach groundwater. With contributions from experts in academia and industries, who give a unified treatment of AI methods and their applications in water science, this book help governments, industry, and homeowners not only to address water pollution problems more quickly and efficiently, but also to gain better insight into the implementation of more effective remedial measures"
