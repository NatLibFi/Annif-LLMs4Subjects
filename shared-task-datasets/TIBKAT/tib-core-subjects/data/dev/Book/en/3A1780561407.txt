A student's guide to Laplace transforms
"The Laplace transform is a useful mathematical tool encountered by students of physics, engineering, and applied mathematics, within a wide variety of important applications in mechanics, electronics, thermodynamics, and more. However, students often struggle with the rationale behind these transforms, and the physical meaning of the transform results. Using the same approach that has proven highly popular in his other Student's Guides, Professor Fleisch addresses the topics that his students have found most troublesome, providing a detailed and accessible description of Laplace transforms and how they relate to Fourier and Z-transforms, written in plain language, and including numerous, fully worked examples. The book is accompanied by a website containing a rich set of freely available supporting materials, including interactive solutions for every problem in the text, and a series of podcasts in which the author explains the important concepts, equations, and graphs of every section of the book"--
