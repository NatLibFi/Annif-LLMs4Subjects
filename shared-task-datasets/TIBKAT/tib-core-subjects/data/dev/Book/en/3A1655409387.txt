Modern Analysis and Topology
The purpose of this book is to provide an integrated development of modern analysis and topology through the integrating vehicle of uniform spaces. The reader should have taken an advanced calculus course and an introductory topology course. It is intended that a subset of the book could be used for an upper-level undergraduate course whereas much of the full text would be suitable for a one-year graduate class. An attempt has been made to document the history of all the central ideas and references and historical notes are embedded in the text. These can lead the interested reader to the foundational sources where these ideas emerged
