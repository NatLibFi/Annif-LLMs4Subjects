Nanotechnology in Construction : Proceedings of NICOM5
Nanotechnology has already demonstrated surprising potential for improving the performance of construction materials, and many of these recent developments were facilitated by NICOM symposia. The NICOM5 proceedings will cover the emerging opportunities and future use of nanotechnology in construction, and will illustrate the broad potential for application of nanotechnology to challenging problems involving materials and infrastructure
