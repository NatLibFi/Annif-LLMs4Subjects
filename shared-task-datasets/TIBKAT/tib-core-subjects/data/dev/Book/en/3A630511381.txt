Tallinn architecture 1900 - 2010 : architecture guide
Tallinn is well-known for its rich medieval heritage but it also hosts a display of impressive modernist architecture. Unlike ordinary tourist guidebooks, this book focuses on Tallinn architecture of the 20th and 21th centuries. Architectual quality as well as being a representative example of a decade or an era were the criteria for inclusion in the guide. The book opens with a short historical overview of Estonian architecture. This is followed by a guide to the city divided into sections where the buildings are grouped and listed according to their location. The numbered entries start in the Old Town and continue in various directions along the main roads - Pärnu road, Tartu road and Narva road leading up to Merivälja, Kalamaja, Kopli, Kakumäe, Mustamäe and Nömme. The text is illustrated with mostly new but also some historical photographs
