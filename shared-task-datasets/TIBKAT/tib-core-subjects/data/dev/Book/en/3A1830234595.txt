Nonlinear dynamics and quantum chaos : an introduction
This book presents a clear and concise introduction to the field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos, suitable for graduate students in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and in natural sciences in general. This second edition includes additional material and in particular a new chapter on dissipative nonlinear systems. The book provides a thorough and modern introduction to the concepts of dynamical systems' theory combining in a comprehensive way classical and quantum mechanical description. It is based on lectures on classical and quantum chaos held by the author at Heidelberg and Parma University. The book contains exercises and worked examples, which make it ideal for an introductory course for students as well as for researchers starting to work in the field.
