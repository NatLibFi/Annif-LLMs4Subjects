Dealing with Uncertainties : A Guide to Error Analysis
Dealing with Uncertainties proposes and explains a new approach for the analysis of uncertainties. Firstly, it is shown that uncertainties are the consequence of modern science rather than of measurements. Secondly, it stresses the importance of the deductive approach to uncertainties. This perspective has the potential of dealing with the uncertainty of a single data point and of data of a set having differing weights. Both cases cannot be dealt with the inductive approach, which is usually taken. This innovative monograph also fully covers both uncorrelated and correlated uncertainties. The weakness of using statistical weights in regression analysis is discussed. Abundant examples are given for correlation in and between data sets and for the feedback of uncertainties on experiment design.
