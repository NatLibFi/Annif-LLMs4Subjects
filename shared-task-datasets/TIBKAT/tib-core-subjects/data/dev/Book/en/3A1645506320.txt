Matter and Methods at Low Temperatures
This textbook contains a wealth of information essential for successful experiments at low temperatures. The first chapters describe the low-temperature properties of liquids and solid matter, including liquid helium. The major part of the book is devoted to refrigeration techniques and the physics on which they rely, the definition of temperature, thermometry, and a variety of design and construction techniques. The lively style and practical orientation of this text make it easy to read and particularly useful to anyone beginning research in low-temperature physics. Low-temperature scientist
