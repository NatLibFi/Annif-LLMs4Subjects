Ultrafast Lasers : A Comprehensive Introduction to Fundamental Principles with Practical Applications
Linear pulse propagation in dispersive media -- linear pulse propagation -- dispersion compensation -- nonlinear pulse propagation -- relaxation oscillations in lasers -- Q-switching -- active modelocking -- passive modelocking: generation of ultrashort laser pulses -- pulse duration measurements -- noise characterization of pulsed laser signals -- applications of short-pulse lasers -- appendices -- index.
This textbook presents a comprehensive introduction to ultrafast laser physics with a keen awareness of the needs of graduate students. It is self-contained and ready to use for both ultrafast laser courses and background for experimental investigation in the lab. The book starts with an advanced introduction to linear and nonlinear pulse propagation, details Q-switching and modelocking and goes into detail while explaining ultrashort pulse generation and measurement. Finally, the characterization of the laser signals is illustrated, and a broad range of applications presented. A multitude of worked examples and problems with solutions help to deepen the reader's understanding.
