Atsushi Kitagawara Architects
"The Japanese architect Atsushi Kitagawara has been firmly established in the architecture scene of his homeland for 30 years. He is a protagonist of an artistically shaped and expressionistic architectural style, which celebrates the experience of space, without losing sight of the functional requirements. Through numerous award-winning projects, such as the Nakamura Keith Haring Museum, he is constantly exploring new means of construction, composition and usage of materials. He thereby creates complex spatial structures and fa√ßades, which challenge the conventional viewing patterns of the user, whilst never diminishing the human criteria. This volume from the 'Portfolio' series is the first monograph outside of Japan to present prominent current and older projects by Atsushi Kitagawara Architects by means of text and images"--Publisher's description
