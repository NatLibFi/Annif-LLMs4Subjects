Emerging synthesis techniques for luminescent materials
"This book gives the impact of the photoluminescence and study of rare earth doped phosphors for fluorescent lamps, TV tubes, electroluminescent display devices, high quality image intensifiers and SSL (Solid State Lightening), LED and LASER materials Application. Also, it gives information about prediction of earth quake lights, mechanoluminscence sensors, TL-Dosimeters, OSL (optically stimulated luminescence), medical imaging phosphors"--
