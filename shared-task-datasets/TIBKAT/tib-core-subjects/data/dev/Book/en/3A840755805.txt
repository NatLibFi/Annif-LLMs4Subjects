Scintillation dosimetry
"This book marks an important milestone toward greater acceptation and the establishment of scintillation dosimetry in the clinical and the research medical physics community. It was put together with medical physics graduate students and clinical medical physicists in mind but should be a welcome addition to any scientists interested in growing their knowledge in this field. The book also should serve as a reference for those who are or will be interested in getting engaged in research in the area of scintillation dosimetry. It should provide the reader with a strong scientific basis on plastic scintillation dosimetry in particular as well as a wide scope of technical implementations (from point source dosimetry scaling up to 3D volumetric dosimetry and 4D scintillation dosimetry) and clinical applications (from machine quality assurance to small field and in vivo dosimetry). The book also covers related optical techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), Ãˆerenkov and other dosimetry topics. Overall, it represents an up-to-date state of this technology in the field of radiation dosimetry"--
