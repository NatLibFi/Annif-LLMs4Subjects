Fundamental Astronomy
Fundamental Astronomy gives a well-balanced and comprehensive introduction to the various fields of classical and modern astronomy. While emphasizing both the astronomical concepts and the underlying physical principles, the text provides a sound basis for more profound studies in the astronomical sciences. The present revised and enlarged fourth edition of this successful textbook includes a host of new knowledge. The main difference to the previous editions is the restructuring of some chapters. Earlier chapters 5 (Radiation Mechanisms) and 6 (Temperatures) have been combined, and part of the material of the appendices has been absorbed to appropriate places. Also the chapters on the solar system and cosmology have been more extensively revised. In other chapters there are several small revisions. Many of the tables in Appendix C have also been updated
