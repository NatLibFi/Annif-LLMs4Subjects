Waste recycling technologies for nanomaterials manufacturing
This book discusses the recent advances in the wastes recycling technologies to provide low-cost and alternative ways for nanomaterials production. It shows how carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized from different waste sources such as banana fibers, argan (Argania spinosa) seed shells, corn grains, camellia oleifera shell, sugar cane bagasse, oil palm (empty fruit bunches and leaves) and palm kernel shells. Several nanostructured metal oxides (MnO2, Co3O4,â€¦.) can be synthesized via recycling of spent batteries. The recovered nanomaterials can be applied in many applications including: Energy (supercapacitors, solar cells, etc.) water treatments (heavy metal ions and dyes removal) and other applications. Spent battery and agriculture waste are rich precursors for metals and carbon, respectively. The book also explores the various recycling techniques, agriculture waste recycling, batteries recycling, and different applications of the recycled materials. .
