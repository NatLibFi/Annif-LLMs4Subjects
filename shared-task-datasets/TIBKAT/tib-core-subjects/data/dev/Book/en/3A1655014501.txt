Geometric Analysis and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
This well-organized and coherent collection of papers leads the reader to the frontiers of &nbsp;present research in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and the calculus of variations and offers insight into some exciting developments. In addition, most articles also provide an excellent introduction to their background, describing extensively as they do the history of those problems presented, as well as the&nbsp;state of the art and offer a well-chosen guide to the literature. Part I contains the contributions of geometric nature: From spectral theory on regular and singular spaces to regularity theory of solutions of variational problems. Part II consists of articles on partial differential equations which originate from problems in physics, biology and stochastics. They cover elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic cases
