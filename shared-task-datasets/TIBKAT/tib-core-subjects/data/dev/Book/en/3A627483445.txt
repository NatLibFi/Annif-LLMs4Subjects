Introduction to high performance computing for scientists and engineers
"Georg Hager and Gerhard Weller have developed a very approachable introduction to high performance computing for scientists and engineers. Their style and descriptions are easy to read and follow...This book presents a balanced treatment of the theory, technology, architecture, and software for modern high performance computers and the use of high performance computing systems. The focus on scientific and engineering problems makes this both educational and unique. I highly recommend this timely book for scientists and engineers. I believe this book will benefit many readers and provide a fine reference." From the Foreword by Jack Dongarra, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA" "Written by high performance computing (HPC) experts, Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers provides a solid introduction to current mainstream computer architecture, dominant parallel programming models, and useful optimization strategies for scientific HPC. The book facilitates an intuitive understanding of performance limitations without relying on heavy computer science knowledge. It also prepares readers for studying more advanced literature." "Features" "Covers basic sequential optimization strategies and the dominating parallelization paradigms" "Highlights the importance of performance modeling of applications on all levels of a system's architecture" "Contains numerous case studies drawn from the authors' invaluable experiences in HPC user support, performance optimization, and benchmarking" "Explores important contemporary concepts, such as multicore architecture and affinity issues" "Includes code examples in Fortran and, if relevant, C and C++" "Offers downloadable code and an annotated bibliography on the book's Web site"--BOOK JACKET
