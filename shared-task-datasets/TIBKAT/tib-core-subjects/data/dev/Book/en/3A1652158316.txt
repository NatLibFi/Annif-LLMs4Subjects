Finite element analysis with error estimators : an introduction to the FEM and adaptive error analysis for engineering students
Introduction, Mathematical Premliminaries, Element Interpolation and Local Coordinates, One-Dimensional Integration, Error Estimation for Elliptic Problems, Super-convergent Patch Recovery, Variational Methods, Cylindrical Analysis Problems, General Interpolation, Integration Methods, Scalar Fields, Vector Fields, Index, Solutions Manual
This key text is written for senior undergraduate and graduate engineering students. It delivers a complete introduction to finite element methods and to automatic adaptation (error estimation) that will enable students to understand and use FEA as a true engineering tool. It has been specifically developed to be accessible to non-mathematics students and provides the only complete text for FEA with error estimators for non-mathematicians. Error estimation is taught on nearly half of all FEM courses for engineers at senior undergraduate and postgraduate level; no other existing textbook for this market covers this topic. *The only introductory FEA text with error estimation for students of engineering, scientific computing and applied mathematics *Includes source code for creating and proving FEA error estimators *Complete with homework exercises and supporting website with instructor's solutions manual
