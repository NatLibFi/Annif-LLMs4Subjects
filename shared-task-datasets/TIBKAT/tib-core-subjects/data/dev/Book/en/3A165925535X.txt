Graduate migration and regional development : an international perspective
This book aims to integrate and augment current state-of-the-art knowledge on graduate migration and its role in local economic development. Offering an international perspective, it is the first focused book of its kind on graduate migration, a recognised and critical component of the global pool of labour. Written by the key scholars working in the field, it draws together an international series of case studies. Each chapter describes empirically founded approaches to examining the role and characteristics of graduate migration in differing situational contexts, highlighting issues concerning government policy, data and methods. Crucially, it assesses the role highly educated individuals play in regional economic development and the determinants of graduate mobility, revealing the characteristics that attract and retain graduates. This unique book is an essential volume for scholars and researchers of geography, regional studies, labour and migration seeking an in-depth, international understanding of human-capital attraction and retention
