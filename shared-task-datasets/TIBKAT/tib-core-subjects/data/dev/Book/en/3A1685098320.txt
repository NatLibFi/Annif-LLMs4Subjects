Mathematical modeling of real world problems : interdisciplinary studies in applied mathematics
"Data mining provides avenues for proper understanding of real world problems. For researchers interested in data mining and new applications, this book is a multidisciplinary 'handbook' in data processes, engineering and medical applications. The authors from the different parts of the world discuss major issues of importance for integrated mathematical implementation and developing experiences. From the general spectrum, the individual spectra can be allowing for separate detection and monitoring of the problem by decomposing the space and time series into signal and noise components. It provides an up-front review of mathematical modeling of real world problems and interdisciplinary studies in applied mathematics that are not only for scientists, engineers, planners or, social scientists but because also everyone can read and understand the real world problems from environment to medicine and their interaction to mathematical implementation. Mathematical studies of the book are aimed to analyze and visualize real world problems in engineering and environmental studies like drought survey, precipitation and erosivity, cloud clarification, estimation of convection scheme and non-linear time series of air pollution, water management, water quality and river pollution and also in medical sciences like, ECG analyses, neurosurgery, computational neuroscience, brain disasters, Parkinson diseases, support vector machine, logic and mathematics. Authors recommend it to researchers with an interest in interaction of social, environmental, agricultural and medical scientists, engineers and planners who are applying wavelets and applied mathematics in their research"--
