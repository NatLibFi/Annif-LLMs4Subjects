Main group chemistry
This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Main Group Chemistry covers the chemistry of the s- and p-block elements, together with a brief chapter on the chemistry of zinc, cadmium and mercury, often classified as main group elements rather than as transition elements. The Periodic Table is an important predictive tool in main group chemistry and in this book, forms the basis for describing the trends and variations in the chemistry of the elements. Introductory material covers the basic principles behind the Periodic Table, bonding, electronegativity and VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. The chemistry of various groups of elements is then discussed. The book incorporates a valuable chapter on inorganic polymers, discussing the chemistry of materials such as silicates, silicones, phosphazenes and diamond. Additional material is available on the website at www.rsc.org/tct Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses.  Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples
