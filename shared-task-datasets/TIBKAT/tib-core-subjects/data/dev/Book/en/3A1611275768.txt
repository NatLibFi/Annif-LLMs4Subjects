Laser beam shaping : theory and techniques
"This book provides a working understanding of the fundamentals of laser beam shaping techniques, as well as insight into the potential application of laser beam profile shaping in laser system design. It covers the theory and practical application of every important technique for lossless beam shaping, explains when beam shaping is practical and when it is not, offers guidance on when each technique is appropriate, and includes experimental results in most cases. Beam measurement techniques are also treated in considerable detail"--
