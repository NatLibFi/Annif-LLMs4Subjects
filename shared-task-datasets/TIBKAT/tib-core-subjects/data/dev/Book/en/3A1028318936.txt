An introduction to Laplace transforms and Fourier series
This book is a self-contained introduction to Laplace Transforms and Fourier Series; emphasising the applications of Laplace transforms throughout, the book also provides coverage of the underlying pure mathematical structures. Alongside the Laplace transform, the notion of Fourier series is developed from first principles. Exercises are provided to consolidate understanding of the concepts and techniques, and only a knowledge of elementary calculus and trigonometry is assumed. For second and third year students looking for a rigorous and practical introduction to the subject, this book will be an invaluable source
