Fiber optic sensors : an introduction for engineers and scientists
"Fiber-optic sensors are a powerful class of sensors, bringing to measurement systems many of the advantages that optical-fiber technology has brought to communications systems. The very high bandwidth of optical fibers allows them to convey a large amount of measurand information through a single fiber. In addition, fiber-optic sensors are intrinsically safe in explosive environments (no sparks), lightweight, compact, robust, and potentially inexpensive. They are therefore useful as sensing devices for a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena that include temperature, pressure, acoustic field, position, rotation, electrical current, liquid level, biochemical composition, and chemical concentration"--
