Topics in Stochastic Systems: Modelling, Estimation and Adaptive Control
This book contains a collection of survey papers in the areas of modelling, estimation and adaptive control of stochastic systems describing recent efforts to develop a systematic and elegant theory of identification and adaptive control. It is meant to provide a fast introduction to some of the recent achievements. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in statistical problems of control in general. Students in robotics and communication will also find it valuable. Readers are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of probability theory and stochastic processes
