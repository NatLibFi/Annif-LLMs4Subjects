Magnetism : from fundamentals to nanoscale dynamics
The present text book gives an comprehensive account of magnetism, spanning the historical development, the physical foundations and the continuing research underlying the field, one of the oldest yet still vibrant field of physics. It covers both the classical and quantum mechanical aspects of magnetism and novel experimental techniques. Perhaps uniquely, it also discusses spin transport and magnetization dynamics phenomena associated with atomically and spin engineered nano-structures against the backdrop of spintronics and magnetic storage and memory applications. Despite the existence of various books on the topic, a fresh text book that reviews the fundamental physical concepts and uses them in a coherent fashion to explain some of the forefront problems and applications today was thought useful by the authors and their colleagues. Magnetism is written for students on the late undergraduate and the graduate levels and should also serve as a state-of-the-art reference for scientists in academia and research laboratories.
