Treatment of Cooling Water
Many cooling systems use water as cooling medium. They are found in public buildings, industrial production systems or power plants. Almost every cooling system using water is degraded by deposition, corrosion and microbiological fouling. This book identifies the problems due to water cooling systems and proposes specific solutions to them
