Designing plastic parts for assembly
For 27 years, "Designing Plastic Parts for Assembly" has been the definitive guide for both seasoned part designers and novices to the field, facilitating cost-effective design decisions and ensuring that the plastic parts and products will stand up under use. The detailed yet simplified discussion of material selection, manufacturing techniques, and assembly procedures enables the reader to evaluate plastic materials and design plastic parts with confidence. Good joint design and implementation, the geometry and nature of the component parts, the types of load involved, and other fundamental information necessary for a successful outcome are all included. Throughout, the treatment is practice-oriented and focused on everyday problems and situations. The 9th edition provides an inside look, through detailed case histories in Chapter 3, on how to design plastic parts to prevent injuries and even death. It also features additional information on application of laser welding, an extension of the chapter on fasteners to cover application of thread-cutting bolts, and many more minor updates and improvements throughout.
