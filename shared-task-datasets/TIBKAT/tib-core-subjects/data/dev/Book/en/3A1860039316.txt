Rounding errors in algebraic processes
"Rounding Errors in Algebraic Processes was the first book to give systematic analyses of the effects of rounding errors on a variety of key computations involving polynomials and matrices. A detailed analysis is given of the rounding errors made in the elementary arithmetic operations and inner products, for both floating-point arithmetic and fixed-point arithmetic. The results are then applied in the error analyses of a variety of computations involving polynomials as well as the solution of linear systems, matrix inversion, and eigenvalue computations. The conditioning of these problems is investigated. The aim was to provide a unified method of treatment, and emphasis is placed on the underlying concepts."-- Back cover
