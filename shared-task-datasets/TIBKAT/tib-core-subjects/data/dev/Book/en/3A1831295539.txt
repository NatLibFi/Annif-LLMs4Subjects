Biowaste and biomass in biofuel applications
"This book reflects the new dimension of biofuel production from its introductory principles to the advancements from a future prospective. It summarizes the rationale for changes in liquid fuel utilization and selection of new technologies with an aim to make biofuel cost-effective to move towards a carbon-neutral approach. It provides an evidence-based outline of how additives and nanotechnology chemically change the quality and effectiveness of biofuels including new and innovative approaches such as nanomaterials and various nano-additives. Features: Provides an overview of the biowaste as a sustainable source in the field of biofuel production. Includes effective conversion parameters of the biowaste feedstocks and their classification. Summarizes current research into the development and exploitation of new biofuel sources. Discusses improvement of pilot scale scalability, and chemical processing and design flow. Presents relevant and realistic global explanations on biowaste management techniques for biofuels. This book is aimed at senior undergraduate, graduate students, and researchers in bioprocessing, chemical engineering, and biotechnology"--
