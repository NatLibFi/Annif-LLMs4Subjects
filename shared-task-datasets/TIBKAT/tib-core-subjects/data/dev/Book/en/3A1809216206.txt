"Scilab is free and open-source for numerical computation. It gives a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications including numerical analysis, data analysis, algorithm development, and application development. It was released in 1994 and since then it has been continuously used across the globe with around 100,000 monthly downloads. Scilab has grabbed a lot of attention in recent years because of its free availability and MATLAB like features. Teachers and undergraduate students favour using this tool in classrooms but there are very few books available on Scilab, covering detailed concepts in physics. While focusing on the curriculum requirements of undergraduate students in physics and electronics, this textbook caters to a wide audience including chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and electronics"--
