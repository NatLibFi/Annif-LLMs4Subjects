The Routledge handbook on the reception of classical architecture
Rethinking Ornament in Classical Architecture : Spolia and Architecture as institutio / Clare E.L. Guest -- The Reception and Involution of Classical Architecture in Jesuit Missions in China (1583-1759) / Xiao Jing -- Avatars of the Classical Tradition in Romanian Architecture / Ana Maria Zahariade and Horia Moldovan -- Modernism and Classicism in Brazil : Foundational Myths and Other Stories / Daniela Sandler.
"This is the first book to examine the reception of the classical tradition in architecture in different regions of the world. Exploring the impact of colonialism, the authors show how classical principles were disseminated across the globe, highlighting both similarities and differences. By identifying numerous unresolved and contentious issues, they question long-held assumptions and draw attention to the Euro-centric nature of existing approaches to classical architecture. Featuring over thirty essays from a range of international scholars, the book is divided into three parts: I) Thematics of Classical Architecture; II) Classical Architecture and the Trading Routes; III) Geographical and Historical Survey. Part III covers Europe and the Levant, Asia and the Indian Subcontinent, the Americas, and Australasia, with essays dedicated to countries such as Italy, France, Germany, England, the Nordic countries, Greece, Russia, Lebanon, India, China, Korea, North and South America, New Zealand, and Australia. An essential reference guide, The Routledge Handbook on the Reception of Classical Architecture makes a major contribution to the study of architectural history"--
