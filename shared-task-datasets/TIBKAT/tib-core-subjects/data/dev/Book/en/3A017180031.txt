Selecta
Provides a clear overview of the works of Edmund Hlawka - Edmund Hlawka is a leading number theorist whose work has had a lasting influence on modern number theory and other branches of mathematics. He has contributed to diophantine approximation, the geometry of numbers, uniform distributions, analytic number theory, discrete geometry, convexity, numerical integration, inequalities, differential equations and gas dynamics. Of particular importance are his results in the geometry of numbers (especially the Minkowski-Hlawka theorem) and uniform distribution. This Selecta volume contains his most important articles, many of which had not been easily accessible. It will provide a useful tool for researchers and graduate students working in the areas covered. E. Hlawka has contributed a general introduction.
