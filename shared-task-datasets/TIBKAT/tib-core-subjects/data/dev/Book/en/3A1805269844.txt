Quantum information and quantum optics with superconducting circuits
"The dawn of the 20th century brought us the birth of quantum mechanics and a deeper understanding of the miscroscopic world. The new theory describing photons, atomic spectra and many other physical processes, postulates that the microscopic world is, in its truest essence, probabilistic. Particles such as electrons or photons move or "propagate" as probability waves to be detected at a given position, or in a given state. However, those waves or wavefunctions are very different from a mere representation of our ignorance about the world"--
