Circularly polarized dielectric resonator antennas
This book introduces 5 key feeding techniques such as coaxial probe, microstrip, conformal strip, aperture, and coplanar waveguide and covers different shapes of dielectric resonator antennas leading to improvement in circularly polarized (CP) performance. It introduces advancements in the field of dielectric resonator antennas and dilectric resonator antennas (DRAs). Five different types of feeding techniques (i.e. coaxial probe, microstrip, conformal strip, aperture, and coplanar waveguide) are described for obtaining CP followed by two modified shaped DRA (sector DRAs). Throughout this book, rectangular and circular with their modified shapes of the dielectric resonator are utilized, providing differing degrees of freedom as well as different variable parameters, including length, width, height, radius, aspect ratio and dielectric constant, which are tuned to obtain the desired antenna parameters
