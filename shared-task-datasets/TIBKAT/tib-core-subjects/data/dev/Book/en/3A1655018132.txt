Nonlinear Parabolic and Elliptic Equations
In response to the growing use of reaction diffusion problems in many fields, this monograph gives a systematic treatment of a class of nonlinear parabolic and elliptic differential equations and their applications these problems. It is an important reference for mathematicians and engineers, as well as a practical text for graduate students
