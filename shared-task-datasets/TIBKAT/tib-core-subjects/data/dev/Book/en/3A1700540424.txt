Statistics for business and economics
For courses in Business Statistics. A classic text for accuracy and statistical precision. Statistics for Business and Economics enables students to conduct serious analysis of applied problems rather than running simple “canned” applications. This text is also at a mathematically higher level than most business statistics texts and provides students with the knowledge they need to become stronger analysts for future managerial positions. In this regard, it emphasizes an understanding of the assumptions that are necessary for professional analysis. In particular, it has greatly expanded the number of applications that utilize data from applied policy and research settings. The Ninth Edition of this book has been revised and updated to provide students with improved problem contexts for learning how statistical methods can improve their analysis and understanding of business and economics. This revision recognizes the globalization of statistical study and in particular the global market for this book.  MyLab Business Statistics is not included
