High-efficient low-cost photovoltaics : recent developments
This book offers a bird’s-eye view of the recent development trends in photovoltaics – a big business field that is rapidly growing and well on its way to maturity. The book describes current efforts to develop highly efficient, low-cost photovoltaic devices based on crystalline silicon, III–V compounds, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and perovskite photovoltaic cells along with innovative, cost-competitive glass/ flexible tubular glass concentrator modules and systems, highlighting recent attempts to develop highly efficient, low-cost, flexible photovoltaic cells based on CIGS and perovskite thin films. This second edition presents, for the first time, the possible applications of perovskite modules together with Augsburger Tubular photovoltaics
