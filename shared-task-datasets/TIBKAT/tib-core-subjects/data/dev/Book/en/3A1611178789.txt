NMR spectroscopy of polymers
NMR Spectroscopy of Polymers places emphasis on the practical use of NMR spectroscopy in polymer chemistry rather than the theoretical treatments. Based on the authors' extensive experimental experience,topics covered include (1) experimental problems such as preparation of sample solution, selection of solvent, internal standard and tube, and contaminants in sample solution, (2) accuracy and precision of NMR measurements required in the analysis of polymer structure such as tacticity, copolymer composition and chain end structures, (3) volume magnetic susceptibility by NMR, (4) stereochemistry of polymer chains, chemical composition and comonomer sequence distribution in copolymers, and end groups and irregular linkages, (5) on-line coupled size exclusion chromatography(SEC) and NMR spectroscopy(SEC/NMR) in which an NMR spectrometer is set in the SEC system as a detector.
