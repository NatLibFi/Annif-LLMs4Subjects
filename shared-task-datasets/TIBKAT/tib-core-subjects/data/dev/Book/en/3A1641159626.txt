Design examples for high strength steel reinforced concrete columns : a Eurocode 4 approach
This companion volume to Design of High Strength Steel Reinforced Concrete Columns provides a large number of worked examples for the design of high-strength steel reinforced concrete structures. It goes beyond the remit of the Eurocode 4 approach to provide clear analysis within the narrower range of permitted concrete and material strengths in comparison to EC2 and EC3. Special considerations are given to resistance calculations which maximize the full strength of the materials--
SRC column subjected to axial compression -- SRC column with normal strength material -- SRC column with high strength concrete -- SRC column with high strength steel -- SRC column with high strength concrete and steel -- SRC column subjected to combined compression and bending -- SRC column with normal strength material -- SRC column with high strength concrete -- SRC column with high strength steel -- SRC column with high strength materials -- SRC column with different degree of confinement
