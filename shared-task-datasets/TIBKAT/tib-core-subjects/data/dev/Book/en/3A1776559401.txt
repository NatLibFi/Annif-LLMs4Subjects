Utilization of waste biomass in energy, environment and catalysis
"Biomass finds its application as feedstock to produce biofuels and other value-added products, which finds usage in energy and environmental areas with particular focus on bio-energy production from different biomass and high-volume medium-value industrial products. This book investigates problems of controlled synthesis of these materials and the effect of their morphological, physical, and chemical characteristics on their adsorption or desorption capacity and recent progress in green catalysts derived from biomass for various catalytic applications. Socio-economic impacts on environment and climate regarding waste biomass are discussed as well. Features
