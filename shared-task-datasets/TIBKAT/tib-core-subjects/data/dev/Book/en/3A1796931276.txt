After : the Australian ugliness
Robin Boyd's The Australian Ugliness was published in 1960 and quickly took its place as a key work of architectural and cultural critique in the nation's canon. This new book responds to Boyd's most well-known text with new critical and creative writing by authors from a range of disciplines. Through different styles and approaches, each author makes Boyd's work live in the contemporary moment, exploring enduring questions about the elusive, sometimes lucky and sometimes ugly character of Australia today. Richly illustrated with new photography by David Wadelton and drawings by Oslo Davis, After The Australian Ugliness is a provocative reflection on how Australia sees itself today, and how others see it. --
