Isotope geochemistry
"In the preface to the first edition of this book I noted the vast impact that isotope geochemistry has had on the earth sciences in the previous half century. That impact has only grown over the last decade. I stated that nearly every earth scientist needs some exposure to, if not fluency in, isotope geochemistry. That is even more true today"
