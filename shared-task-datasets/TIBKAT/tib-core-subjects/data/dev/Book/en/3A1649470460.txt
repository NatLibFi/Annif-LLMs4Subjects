Astronomical Sketching: A Step-by-Step Introduction
At some time we have all gazed through the telescope eyepiece at the magnificent rings and banded globe of Saturn, or seen long shadows reaching across crater floors at the Moonâ€™s terminator - and wondered at the sheer beauty of the sight. It seems almost anachronistic to think of sketching when CCD imaging is available, but astronomical sketching provides an entirely different and deeply personal experience. It means spending time at the eyepiece to really look at what you can see, training your eye to perceive ever greater detail to take the fullest advantage of your telescope's light grasp and resolution. And of course, good astronomical sketches are artwork in themselves, for display and decoration in the home or observatory. Astronomical Sketching is as an easy, step-by-step introduction to sketching celestial objects. It brings together five talented astronomical sketch artists, each of whom has a unique mastery of the media along with the ability to teach their own techniques. Here is a wealth of knowledge, tips and techniques for every aspiring astronomical artist!
