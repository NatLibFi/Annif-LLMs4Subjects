Liquid and crystal nanomaterials for water pollutants remediation
"This book is on liquid and crystal nanomaterials and aimed for products and processes that are ecofriendly, economically-sustainable, energy-efficient, decrease waste. In this book comprehensive information on introduction, generation and application of such nanomaterials for removal of water-pollutant has been provided. This book will also assist to develop the policy and implementation to lower the risk of exposure of such materials. These aspects need to be pursued in the future for investigating and assessing health-risks due to exposure to these materials. Overall aim of this handbook is to focus on recent developments in the area of fabrication of such materials and their utilization in removal water-pollutants"--
