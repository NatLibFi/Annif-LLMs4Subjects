A practical guide to microstructural analysis of cementitious materials
Sample preparation -- Calorimetry -- Characterisation of development of cement hydration using chemical shrinkage -- X-ray powder diffraction applied to cement -- Thermagravimetric analysis -- High-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of portland cement-based systems -- Proton nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry -- Electron microscopy -- Mercury intrusion porosimetry -- Laser diffraction and gas adsorption techniques -- Ternary phase diagrams applied to hydrated cement
"This edited volume provides the cement science community with a state-of-the-art overview of analytical techniques used in cement chemistry to study the hydration and microstructure of cements. Each chapter focuses on a specific technique, not only describing the basic principles behind the technique, but also providing essential, practical details on its application to the study of cement hydration. Each chapter sets out present best practice, and draws attention to the limitations and potential experimental pitfalls of the technique. Databases that supply examples and that support the analysis and interpretation of the experimental results strengthen a very valuable ready reference."--Back cover
