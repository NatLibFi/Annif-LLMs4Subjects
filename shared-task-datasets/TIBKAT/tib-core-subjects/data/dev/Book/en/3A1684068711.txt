Nachhaltigkeit und Digitalisierung : wie digitale Innovationen zu den Sustainable Development Goals beitragen
Whether smartphone, smart home or smart city—digitalisation determines almost all areas of our lives today. The topic of sustainability is also omnipresent in 2019 and numerous challenges associated with it are currently being discussed. Digitalisation and sustainability can thus be regarded as the two megatrends of the 21st century. The question of whether digitalisation is an instrument for achieving sustainable development is increasingly at the centre of the debate. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed by the United Nations as part of the 2030 Agenda are of particular interest for assessing digitalisation as a potential means of achieving sustainable development. With the help of empirical work by students from the University of Kaiserslautern, this edited volume provides answers to the question of how different digital technologies can help to achieve these 17 goals.
