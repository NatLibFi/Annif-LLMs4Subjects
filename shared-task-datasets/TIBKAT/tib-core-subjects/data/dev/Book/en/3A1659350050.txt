This book presents a systematic overview of approximation by linear combinations of positive linear operators, a useful tool used to increase the order of approximation. Fundamental and recent results from the past decade are described with their corresponding proofs. The volume consists of eight chapters that provide detailed insight into the representation of monomials of the operators Ln , direct and inverse estimates for a broad class of positive linear operators, and case studies involving finite and unbounded intervals of  real and complex functions. Strong converse inequalities of Type A in terminology of Ditzian-Ivanov for linear combinations of Bernstein and Bernstein-Kantorovich operators and various Voronovskaja-type estimates for some linear combinations are analyzed and explained. Graduate students and researchers in approximation theory will find the list of open problems in approximation of linear combinations useful. The book serves as a reference for graduate and postgraduate courses as well as a basis for future study and development.
