The Routledge companion to Italian fascist architecture : reception and legacy
"The Routledge Companion to the Reception of Italian Fascist Architecture investigates what has become of the architectural and urban projects of Italian Fascism, how sites have been transformed or adapted, and what constitutes the meaning of these buildings and cities today. Essays include a rich array of new arguments by both senior and early career scholars from Italy and beyond. They examine the reception of fascist architecture through studies of destruction and adaptation, debates over re-use, artistic interventions, and even routine daily practices, which may slowly alter collective understandings of such places. Paolo Portoghesi sheds light on the subject from his internal perspective, while Harald Bodenschatz situates Italy among period totalitarian authorities and their symbols across Europe. Section editors frame, synthesize and moderate essays that explore Fascism's afterlife; how the physical legacy of the regime has been altered and preserved and what it means now. This critical history of interpretations of fascist-era architecture and urban projects broadens our understanding of the relationships among politics, identity, memory and place. This Companion will be of interest to students and scholars in a range of fields including: Italian history, architectural history, cultural studies, visual sociology, political science and art history"--
