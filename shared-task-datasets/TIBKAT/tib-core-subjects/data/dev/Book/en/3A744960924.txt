Classical and Quantum Dynamics : From Classical Paths to Path Integrals
Graduate students who want to become familiar with advanced computational strategies in classical and quantum dynamics will find here both the fundamentals of a standard course and a detailed treatment of the time-dependent oscillator, Chern-Simons mechanics, the Maslov anomaly and the Berry phase, together with many worked examples throughout the text.This new edition has been revised and enlarged with chapters on the action principle in classical electrodynamics, on the functional derivative approach, and on computing traces
