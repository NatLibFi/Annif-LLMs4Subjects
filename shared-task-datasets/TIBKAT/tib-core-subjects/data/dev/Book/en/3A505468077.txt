The global climate system : patterns, processes, and teleconnections
Over the last 20 years, developments in climatology have provided an amazing array of explanations for the pattern of world climates. This textbook, first published in 2006, examines the earth's climate systems in light of this incredible growth in data availability, data retrieval systems, and satellite and computer applications. It considers regional climate anomalies, developments in teleconnections, unusual sequences of recent climate change, and human impacts upon the climate system. The physical climate forms the main part of the book, but it also considers social and economic aspects of the global climate system. This textbook has been derived from the authors' extensive experience of teaching climatology and atmospheric science. Each chapter contains an essay by a specialist in the field to enhance the understanding of selected topics. An extensive bibliography is included and lists of websites for further study. This textbook will be invaluable to advanced students of climatology and atmospheric science.
