Ecological model types
Introduction : an overview -- Biogeochemical models -- Steady state models -- Earth's surface modeling -- Application of structurally dynamic models (SDMs) -- Artificial neural networks : multilayer perceptron for ecological modeling -- Ecotoxicological models -- Fugacity models -- Fuzzy adaptive management of coupled natural and human systems -- Coastal ecosystem modeling in the context of climate change : an overview with case studies
"Ecological Model Types brings an understanding on how to quantitatively analyze complex and dynamic ecosystems with the tools available today. Ecosystem studies widely use the notions of order, complexity, randomness, and organization, and are used interchangeably in literature, which causes much confusion.  Better models synthesize our knowledge on ecosystems and their environmental problems, in contrast to statistical analysis, which only reveal the relationships between the data. This book brings together experts on ecological models to create a definitive work on how to understand our complete earth" --
