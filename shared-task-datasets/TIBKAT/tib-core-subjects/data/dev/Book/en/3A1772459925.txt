Microbial remediation of azo dyes with prokaryotes
"This book details microbial remediation of azo dyes from wastewater including information on existing methods and technologies, their graduation, the emergence of new technologies, industrial practices, and real-case studies. Emphasis is placed on industrial applications and the elimination of toxic pollutants from wastewater through bacterial approach. Specific aspects discussed include effective separation through new adsorbents / newcomers, ion exchange process, coagulation / formulations, separations, and biological methods from wastewater. This book explains a paradigm shift towards the recovery of materials and energy from azo dye containing wastewater. Features
