Cyclotomic Fields I and II
This book is a combined edition of the books previously published as Cyclotomic Fields, Vol. I and II. It continues to provide a basic introduction to the theory of these number fields, which are of great interest in classical number theory, as well as in other areas, such as K-theory. Cyclotomic Fields begins with basic material on character sums, and proceeds to treat class number formulas, p-adic L-functions, Iwasawa theory, Lubin-Tate theory, and explicit reciprocity laws, and the Ferrero-Washington theorems, which prove Iwasawa's conjecture on the growth of the p-primary part of the ideal class group
