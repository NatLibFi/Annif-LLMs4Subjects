Fundamentals of wastewater-based epidemiology : biosurveillance of bacteria, protozoa, COVID-19, and other viruses
"It is common practice to evaluate wastewater to understand drug consumption, from antibiotics to illegal narcotics, and even to analyze dietary habits and trends. Evaluating contaminants in wastewater enables researchers, environmental scientists, and water quality experts to gain valuable information and data. Wastewater-based epidemiology is an emerging science that has proven to be a cost- and time-effective biomonitoring tool. This book provides a roadmap to detecting wastewater-borne pathogenic contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and others. It provides a basic, fundamental discussion of how sampling and monitoring of wastewater using epidemiological concepts and practices can aid in determining the presence of the COVID-19 virus in a community, for example, and may help predict future outbreaks. Offers a unique discussion of the detection of bacteria, fungi, and COVID-19 and other viruses in wastewater. Presents the fundamentals of wastewater chemistry and microbiology. Explains biomonitoring, sampling, testing, and health surveillance in a practical manner. Fundamentals of wastewater-based epidemiology : biomonitoring of bacteria, fungi, COVID-19, and other viruses is an invaluable resource to a wide array of readers with varying interests and backgrounds in water science and public health"--
