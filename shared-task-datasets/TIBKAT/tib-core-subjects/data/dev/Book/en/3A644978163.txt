Affine Flag Manifolds and Principal Bundles
Affine flag manifolds are infinite dimensional versions of familiar objects such as Gra√ümann varieties. The book features lecture notes, survey articles, and research notes - based on workshops held in Berlin, Essen, and Madrid - explaining the significance of these and related objects (such as double affine Hecke algebras and affine Springer fibers) in representation theory (e.g., the theory of symmetric polynomials), arithmetic geometry (e.g., the fundamental lemma in the Langlands program), and algebraic geometry (e.g., affine flag manifolds as parameter spaces for principal bundles). Novel aspects of the theory of principal bundles on algebraic varieties are also studied in the book.
