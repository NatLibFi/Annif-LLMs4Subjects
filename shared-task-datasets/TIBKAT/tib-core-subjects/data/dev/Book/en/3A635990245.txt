Transmission Problems for Elliptic Second-Order Equations in Non-Smooth Domains
The goal of this book is to investigate the behaviour of weak solutions to the elliptic transmisssion problem in a neighborhood of boundary singularities: angular and conic points or edges. We consider this problem both for linear and quasi-linear (till now very little studied) equations. Chapter 1 is of auxiliary character. Chapter 2 deals with the eigenvalue problem for the m-Laplace-Beltrami operator. By the variational principle we prove a new integro-differential Friedrichs-Wirtinger type inequality. This inequality is a basis for the obtaining of precise exponents of the decreasing rate of the solution near boundary singularities. Chapter 3 deals with the investigation of the transmission problem for linear elliptic second order equations in the domains with boundary conic point. Chapter 4 is devoted to the transmission problem in conic domains with N different media for an equation with the Laplace operator in the principal part. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 deal with the investigation of the transmission problem for quasi-linear elliptic second order equations in the domains with boundary conic point or with an edge at the boundary of a domain.
This book investigates the behaviour of weak solutions to the elliptic transmisssion problem in a neighborhood of boundary  singularities: angular and conic points or edges, considering this problem both for linear and quasi-linear equations.
