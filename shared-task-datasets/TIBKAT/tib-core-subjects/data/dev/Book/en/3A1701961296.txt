Current trends and future developments on (bio-)membranes : cogeneration systems and membrane technology
"Co-generation Systems and Membrane Technology offers an exhaustive overview of the status of the cogeneration systems as they relate to advanced membrane technologies for energy savings. The different options for cogeneration are analyzed both for large (district) and small (residential) size units with different primary fuels. Energy efficiency is reported and life cycle analysis is carried out for all different options. The book outlines strategies for engineering development and process intensification of interest to both industrial and developing countries. Finally the book includes three chapters on life cycle analysis (LCA) and economic analysis"--
