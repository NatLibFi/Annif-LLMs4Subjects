Multifunctional pharmaceutical nanocarriers
The use of nanoparticulate pharmaceutical carriers to enhance the in vivo efficiency of many drugs well established itself over the past decade both in pharmaceutical research and clinical setting. Looking into the future of the field of drug delivery, we have to think about the development of the next generation of pharmaceutical nanocarriers combining the whole variety of properties and allowing for the simultaneous performance of multiple functions. Surface modification of pharmaceutical carriers is often used to control their properties in a desirable fashion and make them to simultaneously perform several different functions.  This book is all about these "futuristic" multifunctional medicines. Multifunctional Pharmaceutical Nanocarriers intends to bring together the experts in the field of multifunctional nanopharmaceuticals to provide the reader with the cutting edge information, a critical overview of the field, and analysis of the current and future tendencies and developments to aid in the rapid developments in the field.
The editors have brought together leading experts in multifunctional nanopharmaceuticals to provide cutting edge information; a critical overview of the field; and analysis of current and potential future developments to speed the subject's rapid development.
