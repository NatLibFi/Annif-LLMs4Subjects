Ancient Mathematics : History of Mathematics in Ancient Greece and Hellenism
How Greek science began -- Thales of Miletus -- Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans -- Hippocrates of Chios -- Athens and the Academy -- Plato -- Aristotle and the Lykeion -- Alexandria -- Euclid -- Classical problems of Greek mathematics -- Archimedes of Syracuse -- Eratosthenes of Cyrene -- The conic sections -- Apollonius of Perga -- The beginnings of trigonometry -- Heron of Alexandria -- Klaudios Ptolemaios -- Nicomachus of Gerasa -- Theon of Smyrna -- Diophantos of Alexandria -- Pappos of Alexandria -- Theon of Alexandria -- Proklos Diadochos -- Roman mathematics -- The heritage of Hellenistic mathematics.
The volume contains a comprehensive and problem-oriented presentation of ancient Greek mathematics from Thales to Proklos Diadochos. Exemplarily, a cross-section of Greek mathematics is offered, whereby also such works of scientists are appreciated in detail, of which no German translation is available. Numerous illustrations and the inclusion of the cultural, political and literary environment provide a great spectrum of the history of mathematical science and a real treasure trove for those seeking biographical and contemporary background knowledge or suggestions for lessons or lectures. The presentation is up-to-date and realizes tendencies of recent historiography. In this book, the central chapters on Plato, Aristotle and Alexandria have been updated. The explanations of Greek calculus, mathematical geography and mathematics of the early Middle Ages have been expanded and show new points of view. A completely new addition is a unique illustrated account of Roman mathematics. Also newly included are several color illustrations that successfully illustrate the book's subject matter. With more than 280 images, this volume represents a richly illustrated history book on ancient mathematics. The author Dietmar Herrmann studied mathematics and physics at the Technical University of Munich, graduating with a state examination in 1972. In addition to serving as a high school teacher, he was a successful author of books on programming languages and applied mathematics (statistics, numerics). As a lecturer at the Munich University of Applied Sciences he held lectures on mathematics and computer science for 15 years. As a retired director of studies, he devotes himself to the history of mathematics, which has interested him since his student days. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence. A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content.
