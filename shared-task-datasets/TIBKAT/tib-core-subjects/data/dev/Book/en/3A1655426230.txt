Exact Confidence Bounds when Sampling from Small Finite Universes : An Easy Reference Based on the Hypergeometric Distribution
This book is an extensive and easy to use reference for students and practitioners for finding exact confidence intervals when sampling from finite populations. It can be used by statisticians, engineers, life, physical, and social scientists, quality control personnel, auditors, accountants, and others. The book avoids the need for approximations especially in those cases where many approximations are known to perform poorly. This includes cases where the sample size is small and those cases where certain attributes are rare within the study population. The supporting development and theory of the exact results, provided in the table, are presented in an elementary manner making the book readily useful to a wide audience. While the problem addressed in this book is a common one, the exact solution is not commonly used by many, including statisticians, perhaps because of the involved combinatorics and the required computing. This book removes the need to compute these confidence bounds when sampling from small universes. This book will no doubt serve as a catalyst for research into other exact results and their applications for more complex sampling designs
