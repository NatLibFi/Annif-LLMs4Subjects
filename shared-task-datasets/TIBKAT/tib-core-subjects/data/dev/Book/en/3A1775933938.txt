Computational topology for data analysis
"In this chapter, we introduce some of the very basics that are used throughout the book. First, we give the definition of a topological space and related notions of open and closed sets, covers, subspace topology. To connect topology and geometry, we devote a section on metric spaces. Maps such as homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence that play a significant role to relate topological spaces. Certain categories of topological spaces become important for their wide presence in applications. Manifolds are one such category which we introduce in this chapter. Functions on them satisfying certain conditions are presented as Morse functions. The critical points of such functions relate to the topology of the manifold they are defined on. We introduce these concepts in the smooth setting in this chapter, and later adapt them for the piecewise linear domains frequently used for finite computations. Finally, a section on Notes points out to the history and relevant literature for the concepts delineated in the chapter. It ends with a series of exercises that may be used for teaching a class on the subject both at graduate and undergraduate level"--
