Clinical Neuroembryology : Development and Developmental Disorders of the Human Central Nervous System
The spectacular progress in developmental neurobiology, the dramatic advances in (neuro)genetics and the high resolution of the modern imaging techniques applicable to developmental disorders of the human brain and spinal cord have created a novel insight into the developmental history of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical Neuroembryology provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the human CNS in the context of its many developmental disorders due to genetic, environmental and hypoxic causes. It is unique in the combination of data from human embryology, animal research and developmental neuropathology.
