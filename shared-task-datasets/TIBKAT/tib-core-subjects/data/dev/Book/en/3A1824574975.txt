Plasma physics : an introduction
"Encompasses the Lectured Works of a Renowned Expert in the Field Plasma Physics: An Introduction is based on a series of university course lectures by a leading name in the field, and thoroughly covers the physics of the fourth state of matter. This textbook provides a concise and cohesive introduction to plasma physics theory and offers a solid foundation for students of physics wishing to take higher level courses in plasma physics. Mathematically Rigorous, but Driven by Physics The author provides an in-depth discussion of the various fluid theories typically used in plasma physics, presenting non-relativistic, fully ionized, nondegenerate, quasi-neutral, and weakly coupled plasma. This second edition has been fully updated to include new content on collisions and magnetic reconnection. It contains over 80 exercises-carefully selected for their pedagogical value-with fully worked out solutions available in a separate solutions manual for professors. The material presents a number of applications, and works through specific topics including basic plasma parameters, the theory of charged particle motion in inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields, collisions, plasma fluid theory, electromagnetic waves in cold plasmas, electromagnetic wave propagation through inhomogeneous plasmas, kinetic theory, magnetohydrodynamical fluid theory, and magnetic reconnection"--
