This book introduces the exciting and fast-moving field of MOEMS to graduate students, scientists, and engineers by providing a foundation of both micro-optics and MEMS that will enable them to conduct future research in the field. Born from the relatively new fields of MEMS and micro-optics, MOEMS are proving to be an attractive and low-cost solution to a range of device problems requiring high optical functionality and high optical performance. MOEMS solutions include optical devices for telecommunication, sensing, and mobile systems such as v-grooves, gratings, shutters, scanners, filters, micromirrors, switches, alignment aids, lens arrays, and hermetic wafer-scale optical packaging. An international team of leading researchers contributed to this book, and it presents examples and problems employing cutting-edge MOEM devices. It will inspire researchers to further advance the design, fabrication, and analysis of MOEM systems
