Non-covalent interactions in proteins
"This interdisciplinary book unites comprehensive considerations of the physics of non-covalent interactions with the specificity of their biochemical application in protein sciences, succeeding where pure physics and biochemical textbooks have failed. This second edition includes new chapters on intrinsically disordered proteins, microcalorimetry of proteins, cold denaturation, thermodynamic stability and thermal adaptability of proteins"--
