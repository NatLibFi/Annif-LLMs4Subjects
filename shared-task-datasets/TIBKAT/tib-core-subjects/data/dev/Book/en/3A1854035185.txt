8th Workshop on Theory, Phenomenology and Experiments in Flavour Physics : Neutrinos, Flavor Physics and Beyond (FP@Capri2022)
This book is a collection of invited contributions presented at the 8th edition of the International Workshop on Theory, Phenomenology and Experiments in Flavour Physics, held on the Island of Capri, Italy, on 11â€“13 June 2022. It is a joint workshop between experimentalists and theoreticians aiming at debating recent results and hot topics in flavour physics, in an interdisciplinary effort. Flavour, electroweak physics and neutrino physics are all foremost in the assessment of results within the standard model and search for physics beyond. Anomalies in flavour physics are hints on new physics, while with neutrino masses and oscillations the new physics has already started. Contributions deal mainly with the flavour anomalies, the flavour problem from leptons to quarks and back, including continuous versus discrete symmetries, and the connections between the Higgs sector and neutrinos, embracing see-saw models and Higgs potential analyses. Focus is on neutrinos, at high and low scales, including LHC searches and CLVF, leptogenesis, connections with dark sectors and NP mediators, non-standard neutrino interactions and the problem of the nature of massive neutrinos.
