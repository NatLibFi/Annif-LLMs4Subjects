Probabilistic-Statistical Approaches to the Prediction of Aircraft Navigation Systems Condition
Probalistic-statistical models of complex systems aging process -- Analysis of statistic models of aging navigation systems -- Control characteristics of an aircraft radio navigation devices under destabilizing factors impact -- Basic radiotechnical means to ensure the reliability of the aircraft flight -- Transfer of digital navigational data and assessment of results of decisions made -- Aircraft movement routing in passing to RNAV including reliability characteristics of navigation and communications equipment
This book highlights the development of new methods for assessing and forecasting the state of various complex ageing systems in service; analyzing the influence of destabilizing factors on the accuracy of aircraft flight navigation support; and making recommendations on the ideal aircraft route, taking into consideration the available information on the reliability of the navigation and communication equipment
