Metal nanocomposites for energy and environmental applications
This book focuses on recent developments in metal nanomaterials and nanocomposites for energy and environmental application such as pollution control in water, air, and soil pollution. The chapters incorporate carbon-based, metal-based and metal-organic framework based nanomaterials and nanocomposites for emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and microplastics) and other traditional pollutants remediation along with energy storage, sensing of air and water polutents and carbon capture & storage (CCS). This book will be of interest to those in academia and industry involved in energy and environmental science & engineering research.
