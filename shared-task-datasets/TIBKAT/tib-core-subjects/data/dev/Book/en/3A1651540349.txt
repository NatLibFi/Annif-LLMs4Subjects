Internal and External Stabilization of Linear Systems with Constraints
Linear systems with constraints on inputs and states are ubiquitous. Control of such systems has been a long-time challenge to control engineers and will continue to remain so. Indeed, the challenge of constraints is intense and dauntingly formidable and familiar. This book focuses on the very fundamental and primary goal of providing internal stability as well as external stability in the presence of disturbances and reference inputs. The focus is on both the analysis and design for both continuous- and discrete-time systems. A taxonomy of constraints paves distinct paths showing what is feasible and what is not. Internal and External Stabilization of Linear Systems with Constraints is an excellent reference for practicing engineers, graduate students, and researchers in control systems theory and design. The book may also serve as an advanced graduate text for a course or a seminar in nonlinear control systems theory and design in applied mathematics or engineering departments. Minimal prerequisites include a first graduate course in state-space methods as well as a first course in control systems design.
