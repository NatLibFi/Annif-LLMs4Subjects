Drinfeld moduli schemes and automorphic forms : the theory of elliptic modules with applications
Drinfeld Moduli Schemes and Automorphic Forms: The Theory of Elliptic Modules with Applications is based on the author's original work establishing the correspondence between ell-adic rank r Galois representations and automorphic representations of GL(r) over a function field, in the local case, and, in the global case, under a restriction at a single place. It develops Drinfeld's theory of elliptic modules, their moduli schemes and covering schemes, the simple trace formula, the fixed point formula, as well as the congruence relations and a 'simple' converse theorem, not yet published anywhere --
