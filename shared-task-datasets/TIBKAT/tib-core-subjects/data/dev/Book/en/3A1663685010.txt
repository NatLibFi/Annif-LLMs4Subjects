"Field Theory II begins with the path integral formulation of quantum field theory. Perturbation theory is generalized beyond tree level, to include radiative corrections (loops). The renormalization procedure and Wilsonean renormalization group are discussed, asymptotic freedom of non-Abelian gauge theories derived, and some applications in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) considered, with a brief digression into the Standard Model (SM). Sample higher order corrections are worked out. The SM case requires a study of the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry, a phenomenon which would be more appropriate to call "Higgsing of the gauge bosons""--
