Computational methods for electromagnetics
Computational Methods for Electromagnetics is an indispensable resource for making efficient and accurate formulations for electromagnetics applications and their numerical treatment. Employing a unified coherent approach that is unmatched in the field, the authors detail both integral and differential equations using the method of moments and finite-element procedures. In addition, readers will gain a thorough understanding of numerical solution procedures. Topics covered include: . Two- and three-dimensional integral equation/method-of-moments formulations. Open-region finite-element formulations based on the scalar and vector Helmholtz equations. Finite difference time-domain methods. Direct and iterative algorithms for the solutions of linear systems. Error analysis and the convergence behavior of numerical results. Radiation boundary conditions. Acceleration methods for periodic Green's functions. Vector finite elements Detail is provided to enable the reader to implement concepts in software and, in addition, a collection of related computer programs are available via the Internet. Computational Methods for Electromagnetics is designed for graduate-level classroom use or self-study, and every chapter includes problems. It will also be of particular interest to engineers working in the aerospace, defense, telecommunications, wireless, electromagnetic compatibility, and electronic packaging industries
