Stability analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits
Annotation "Stability Analysis of Nonlinear Microwave Circuits is essential reading for microwave designers working with circuits based on solid state devices, diodes, and transistors, engineers designing radio-frequency circuits, and professionals regularly involved in any area requiring a functional knowledge of nonlinear oscillations and stability concepts. It provides an in-depth look at the very complex and often unforeseen behavior of nonlinear circuits. The book includes detailed coverage of power amplifiers, voltage-controlled oscillators, frequency dividers, frequency multipliers, self-oscillating mixers, and phased-locked loops."--BOOK JACKET.
