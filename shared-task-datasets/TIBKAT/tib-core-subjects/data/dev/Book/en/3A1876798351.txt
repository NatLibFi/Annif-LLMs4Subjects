Homotopy-based methods in water engineering
"Exploring the concept of homotopy from topology, different kinds of homotopy-based methods have been proposed for analytically solving nonlinear differential equations, given by approximate series solutions. Homotopy-Based Methods in Water Engineering attempts to present the wide applicability of these methods to water engineering problems. It solves all kinds of nonlinear equations, namely algebraic/transcendental equations, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), systems of ODEs, partial differential equations (PDEs), system of PDEs, and integro-differential equations using the homotopy-based methods"--
