Cloud native : using containers, functions, data to build next-generation applications
With Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form-the author's raw and unedited content as he or she writes-so you can take advantage of these technologies long before the official release of these titles. You'll also receive updates when significant changes are made, new chapters are available, and the final ebook bundle is released. This comprehensive guide helps developers and architects understand current cloud-native technologies, with recommendations that explain when you need to use each one. Authors Boris Scholl, Trent Swanson, and Peter Jausovec describe the patterns you need for building cloud-native applications, and provide best practices for the most common tasks such as messaging, eventing, and DevOps. This practical book also delivers an architectural blueprint for a modern cloud-native application. You'll learn about microservices, containers, serverless computing, storage types, data considerations, portability, and the use of functions. Differentiate between containers and functions, and understand when to use which technology Leverage Service Meshes to move complexity, such as distributed tracing and mutual TLS handshakes, away from the developer Use messaging and eventing as the glue for the cloud-native composite applications Handle state-in distributed applications Understand what makes your application portable
