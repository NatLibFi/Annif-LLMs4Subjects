A mole of chemistry : an historical and conceptual approach to fundamental ideas in chemistry
Introduction to modern chemistry: The beginning of scientific reasoning -- Introduction to the kinetic theory of gases : the ideal gas concept -- Introduction to thermodynamics : the heat concept -- Introduction to quantum mechanics : wave-particle duality concept -- Introduction to electrochemistry : electron transfer -- Introduction to chemical reactivity : proton transfer -- Introduction to inorganic chemistry : role of symmetry.
"A Mole of Chemistry: An Historical and Conceptual Approach to Fundamental Ideas in Chemistry is intended for students in their undergraduate years, including science, engineering and humanities majors, who need to learn the basics of chemistry. This is a companion textbook which provides a unique perspective on how the main scientific concepts describing nature were discovered and, eventually, how modern chemistry was born. The book makes use of context found in history, philosophy and the arts to better understand the development of chemistry, and contains as few mathematical equations as possible. The focus is then set on scientific reasoning, making this book a great companion and addition to traditional chemistry textbooks"--
