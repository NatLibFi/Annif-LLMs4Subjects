This book examines the issue of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the context of technological development, and in particular the impact of M&As on the innovation process. In so doing, the book integrates two bodies of literature, on M&As, and on innovation studies, a nexus which the editors contend represents an important step in the advancement of our understanding of both with clear implications for competitive advantage and growth of firms. Drawing on perspectives from both management and economics, the book offers a cohesive blend of theory, methodology, and a wealth of empirical material
