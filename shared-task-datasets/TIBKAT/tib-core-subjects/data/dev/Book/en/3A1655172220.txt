Topics in the Theory of Riemann Surfaces
The book's main concern is automorphisms of Riemann surfaces, giving a foundational treatment from the point of view of Galois coverings, and treating the problem of the largest automorphism group for a Riemann surface of a given genus. In addition, the extent to which fixed points of automorphisms are generalized Weierstrass points is considered. The extremely useful inequality of Castelnuovo- Severi is also treated. While the methods are elementary, much of the material does not appear in the current texts on Riemann surfaces, algebraic curves. The book is accessible to a reader who has had an introductory course on the theory of Riemann surfaces or algebraic curves
