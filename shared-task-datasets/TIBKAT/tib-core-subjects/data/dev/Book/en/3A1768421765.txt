Waste and byproducts in cement-based materials : innovative sustainable materials for a circular economy
Waste and By-Products in Cement-Based Materials: Innovative Sustainable Materials for a Circular Economy covers various recycled materials, by-products and wastes that are suitable for the manufacture of materials within the spectrum of so-called cement-based materials (CBM). Sections cover wastes for replacement of aggregates in CBM, focus on the application of wastes for the replacement of clinker and mineral additions in the manufacture of binders, discuss the optimization process surrounding the manufacture of recycled concrete and mortars, multi-recycling, advanced radiological studies, optimization of self-compacting concrete, rheology properties, corrosion prevention, and more. Final sections includes a review of real-scale applications that have been made in recent years of cement-based materials in roads, railway superstructures, buildings and civil works, among others, as well as a proposal of new regulations to promote the use of waste in the manufacture of CBM
