Wave Scattering from Rough Surfaces
Wave Scattering From Rough Surfaces deals with a theory that has many important practical applications. The monograph considers the subject by using the concept of scattering amplitude, which allows one to simplify theoretical constructions and, more importantly, to consider different approaches within a single theoretical scheme. It emphasizes new theoretical approaches developed in this area during the last two decades. For the second edition, a special section was added to present one of the most powerful among recently developed methods, namely the operator expansion method
