Advanced and emerging technologies for resource recovery from wastes
This book introduces advanced or emerging technologies for conversion of wastes into a variety of high-value chemicals and materials. Energy and resources can be recovered from various residential, industrial and commercial wastes, such as municipal wastewater and sludge, e-waste, waste plastics and resins, crop residues, forestry residues and lignin. Advanced waste-to-resource and energy technologies like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, fractionation, de-polymerization, gasification and carbonization are also introduced. The book serves as an essential guide to dealing with various types of wastes and the methods of disposal, recovery, recycling and re-use. As such it is a valuable resource for a wide readership, including graduate students, academic researchers, industrial researchers and practitioners in chemical engineering, waste management, waste to energy and resources conversion and biorefinery.
