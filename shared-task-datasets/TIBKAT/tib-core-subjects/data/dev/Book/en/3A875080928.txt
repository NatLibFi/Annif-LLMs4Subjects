Nonlinear solid mechanics for finite element analysis : statics
Designing engineering components that make optimal use of materials requires consideration of the nonlinear static and dynamic characteristics associated with both manufacturing and working environments. The modeling of these characteristics can only be done through numerical formulation and simulation, which requires an understanding of both the theoretical background and associated computer solution techniques. By presenting both the nonlinear solid mechanics and the associated finite element techniques together, the authors provide, in the first of two books in this series, a complete, clear, and unified treatment of the static aspects of nonlinear solid mechanics. Alongside a range of worked examples and exercises are user instructions, program descriptions, and examples for the FLagSHyP MATLAB computer implementation, for which the source code is available online. While this book is designed to complement postgraduate courses, it is also relevant to those in industry requiring an appreciation of the way their computer simulation programs work
