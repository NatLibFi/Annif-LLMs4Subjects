Electromagnetic technologies in food science
"Different themes of the book are part of what has been referred to as 'emerging technologies' or 'non- thermal methods', which have been developed as a mild preservation method that can be applied as alternatives to conventional thermal treatments. It is in this context where some of the methods, such as pulsed light or photosensitization have evolved and progress has been made. While the aforementioned examples are related to food safety and preservation, the electromagnetic spectrum has been useful in developing quality control methods such as hyperspectral imaging that allows the control of continuous fast-speed processes within the food industry. These are routinely being used in industries that are driven by the market to produce more food at a faster pace to fulfill the increasing demand of the world population"--
