Emerging wireless technologies and the future mobile Internet
"This book provides a preview of emerging wireless technologies and their architectural impact on the future mobile Internet. The reader will find an overview of architectural considerations for the mobile Internet, along with more detailed technical discussion of new protocol concepts currently being considered at the research stage. The first chapter starts with a discussion of anticipated mobile/wireless usage scenarios, leading to an identification of new protocol features for the future Internet. This is followed by several chapters that provide in-depth coverage of next-generation wireless standards, ad hoc and mesh network protocols, opportunistic delivery and delay tolerant networks, sensor network architectures and protocols, cognitive radio networks, vehicular networks, security and privacy, and experimental systems for future Internet research. Each of these contributed chapters includes a discussion of new networking requirements for the wireless scenario under consideration, architectural concepts and specific protocol designs, many still at research stage"--
