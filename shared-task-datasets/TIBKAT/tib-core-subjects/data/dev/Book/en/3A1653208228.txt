Android on x86 : An Introduction to Optimizing for Intel® Architecture
Android on x86: an Introduction to Optimizing for Intel®Architecture serves two main purposes. First, it makes the case for adapting your applications onto Intel’s x86architecture, including discussions of the business potential, the changinglandscape of the Android marketplace, and the unique challenges andopportunities that arise from x86 devices. The fundamental idea is that extending your applications to support x86or creating new ones is not difficult, but it is imperative to know all of thetechnicalities. This book is dedicated to providing you with an awareness ofthese nuances and an understanding of how to tackle them. Second, and most importantly, this book provides a one-stopdetailed resource for best practices and procedures associated with theinstallation issues, hardware optimization issues, software requirements,programming tasks, and performance optimizations that emerge when developersconsider the x86 Android devices. Optimization discussions dive into nativecode, hardware acceleration, and advanced profiling of multimedia applications.The authors have collected this information so that you can use the book as aguide for the specific requirements of each application project. This book is not dedicated solely to code; instead it isfilled with the information you need in order to take advantage of x86architecture. It will guide you throughinstalling the Android SDK for Intel Architecture, help you understand thedifferences and similarities between processor architectures available inAndroid devices, teach you to create and port applications, debug existing x86applications, offer solutions for NDK and C++ optimizations, and introduce theIntel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager. This book provides the mostuseful information to help you get the job done quickly while utilizing bestpractices
