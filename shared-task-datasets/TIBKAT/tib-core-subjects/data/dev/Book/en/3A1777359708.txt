Governance Revisited : Challenges and Opportunities for Vocational Education and Training
Focussing on European countries, this edited volume examines the variety of European VET governance and VET governance research. In particular, it provides insights into regional, local and decentralized governance at meso as well as micro level. As such, the edited volume sheds light on the hitherto far less explored dimensions of VET governance.
