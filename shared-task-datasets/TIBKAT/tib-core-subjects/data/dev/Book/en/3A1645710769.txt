This monograph presents a variety of techniques that can be used for designing robust fault diagnosis schemes for non-linear systems. The introductory part of the book is of a tutorial value and can be perceived as a good starting point for the new-comers to this field. Subsequently, advanced robust observer structures are presented. Parameter estimation based techniques are discussed as well. A particular attention is drawn to experimental design for fault diagnosis. The book also presents a number of robust soft computing approaches utilizing evolutionary algorithms and neural networks. All approaches described in this book are illustrated by practical applications.
