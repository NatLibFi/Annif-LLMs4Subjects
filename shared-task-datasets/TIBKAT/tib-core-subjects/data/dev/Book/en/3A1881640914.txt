Amphibian species in environmental risk assessment strategies
With the expansion of human settlements and the environmental changes brought about by human activity and pollutants, toxicology and risk assessment of amphibian species has become increasingly of interest to toxicologists involved in environmental research. This book focuses specifically on environmental risk assessment in premetamorphic stages and adults of amphibians. Amphibian ecotoxicology is not totally understood in scientific research and as such environmental risk assessment in these vertebrates is an area of rapidly growing interest. It has the potential to answer some of the questions regarding risks to our environment. An ideal companion, this book will be useful to toxicologists and ecologists investigating risk assessment in the environments of amphibians, while also of interest to those working in conservation biology, biological invasion, biocontrol and habitat management
