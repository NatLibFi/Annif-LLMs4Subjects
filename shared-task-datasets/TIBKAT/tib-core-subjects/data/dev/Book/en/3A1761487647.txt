Preface -- Introduction -- Probability and information -- Linear algebra and optimization -- Linear and nonlinear regression -- Perceptron -- Multilayer perceptron -- Learning theory -- Model selection -- Clustering -- Radial basis networks -- Support vector machines -- Deep learning -- Convolutional networks -- Recurrent networks -- Autoencoders -- Epilogue -- Bibliography -- Index.
"This unique compendium discusses some core ideas for the development and implementation of machine learning from three different perspectives - the statistical perspective, the artificial neural network perspective and the deep learning methodology. The useful reference text represents a solid foundation in machine learning and should prepare readers to apply and understand machine learning algorithms as well as to invent new machine learning methods. It tells a story outgoing from a perceptron to deep learning highlighted with concrete examples, including exercises and answers for the students"--Publisher's website
