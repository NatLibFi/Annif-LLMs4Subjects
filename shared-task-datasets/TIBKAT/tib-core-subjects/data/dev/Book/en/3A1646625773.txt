Mass spectrometry today is an indispensable tool in chemistry and life sciences. This book is tailored to guide students and professionals as well as novices to mass spectrometry from other fields. Mass Spectrometry - A Textbook will guide them from their first steps to the successful application of mass spectrometry in their daily work in research. Starting from the very principles of gas phase ion chemistry and isotopic properties, it leads through the design of mass analyzers and the ionization methods in use to mass spectral interpretation and coupling techniques. Step by step the readers will understand how mass spectrometry works and what it can do as a powerful tool in their hands. The book comprises a balanced mixture of practice-oriented information and theoretical background. The clear layout, a wealth of high quality figures and a database with exercises and solutions freely accessible via the publisher’s web site, support the reader’s understanding.
