Routledge handbook of deradicalisation and disengagement
"The Routledge Handbook of Deradicalisation and Disengagement offers an overview of the historical settings, theoretical debates, national approaches and practical strategies to deradicalisation and disengagement. Radicalisation and violent extremism are a major global challenge, and as new and violent extremist groups and environments emerge, there is an increasing need for knowledge about how individuals physically exit these movements and how to change their mindset. Historically, much of the focus on these topics has been highly securitised and militarised; by contrast, this volume explores the need for more community-based and 'soft' approaches. The handbook includes discussions from both right-wing/left-wing political and religiously inspired deradicalisation processes. The handbook is organised into three parts: Definitions, backgrounds and theories; Actors; Regional case studies. This handbook will be of much interest to students of deradicalisation, counter-terrorism, political violence, political extremism, security studies and IR in general"--
