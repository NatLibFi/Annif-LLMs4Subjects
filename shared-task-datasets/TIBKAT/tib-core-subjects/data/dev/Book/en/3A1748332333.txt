Digital modulation techniques
"Packed with nearly 400 illustrations and over 2,500 equations, the book offers full details for every digital modulation technique, including operation principles, bit error probability, spectral characteristics, modulator, demodulator and synchronizer designs, and performance in fading channels. Almost all modulation schemes and their performance evaluation expressions are supported by extensively referenced derivations or proofs, giving professionals the analytical background needed to improve of modify schemes for specific applications."--Jacket
