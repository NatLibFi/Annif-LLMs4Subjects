Rethinking transgender identities : reflections from around the globe
"This volume explores the diversity and complexity of transgender people's experiences and demonstrates that gendered bodies are constructed through different social, cultural and economic networks and through different spaces and places. Rethinking Transgender Identities brings together original research in the form of interviews, participatory methods, and cultural texts and is grouped into the following nine themes: popular culture and new media; indigeneity; law, policy and state; time; place; health; sexualities; and activisms. Each topic is developed in relation to transgender, and will explore the politics, lived realities, strategies, mobilisations, age, ethnicity, activisms, and communities of transgender people, across different spatial scales and times. Taken together, the research will provide a comprehensive and authoritative state-of-the-art review of the current research which will appeal to scholars and graduate students working within the fields of sociology, gender studies, sexuality and queer studies, family studies, media and cultural studies, psychology, health, law, criminology, politics and human geography"--
