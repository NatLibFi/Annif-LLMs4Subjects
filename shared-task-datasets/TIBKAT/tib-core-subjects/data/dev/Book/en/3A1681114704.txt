"Handbook of Citizen Science in Ecology and Conservation is the first practical and comprehensive manual that provides step-by-step instructions for creating natural science research projects that involve collaboration between scientists and the general public. As citizen-science projects become increasingly common, there is a growing need for concrete best practices around planning and implementing successful projects that can allow project leaders to guide and gauge success of projects while ensuring the collection of high-quality data. Based on a variety of case studies from several citizen-science projects, this is the definitive reference guide for all potential citizen-science practitioners, ranging from professors and graduate students to staff at agencies and nongovernmental organizations"--
