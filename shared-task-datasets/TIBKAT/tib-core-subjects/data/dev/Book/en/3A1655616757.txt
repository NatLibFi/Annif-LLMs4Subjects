Biomimetics : Bioinspired Hierarchical-Structured Surfaces for Green Science and Technology
This revised, updated and expanded new edition presents an overview of biomimetics and biologically inspired structured surfaces. It deals with various examples of biomimetics which include surfaces with roughness-induced superomniphobicity, self-cleaning, antifouling, and controlled adhesion. The focus in the book is on the Lotus Effect, Salvinia Effect, Rose Petal Effect, Oleophobic/philic Surfaces, Shark Skin Effect, and Gecko Adhesion. This new edition also contains new chapters on the butterfly wing effect, bio- and inorganic fouling and structure and Properties of Nacre and structural coloration.
