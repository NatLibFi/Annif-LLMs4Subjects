Reflectionless filters
This invaluable resource introduces progressive techniques for the creation of sophisticated reflectionless filter topologies that have identically zero reflection coefficient at all frequencies. Practical implementations are discussed along with their advantages when compared to classical absorptive filters and their benefits in real-world systems such as up/down converters, multiplier chains, broadband amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, and time-domain applications. This book offers insight into the innovative process of developing reflectionless filters from first principles using both lumped elements and transmission lines. Tools for the creation of reflectionless multiplexers, matched sloped equalizers, and advanced, high-order, and nonplanar topologies are also presented
