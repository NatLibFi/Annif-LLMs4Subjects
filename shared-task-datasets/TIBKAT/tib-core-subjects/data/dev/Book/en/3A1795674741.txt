Designing coffee shops and cafés for community
"Designing Coffee Shops and Cafés for Community brings together research, theory and practical applications for designing coffee shops and cafes as places to enhance community connections. As people search for meaning and connection in their lives, they often seek out places that root them in their community. Designers are responsible for creating these spaces, and to do so well, they need to understand the physical and social attributes that make such spaces successful. Addressing societal trends, environment and behavior theories, place attachment, branding, authenticity, location, layout, and ambiance, the book provides guidelines to help designers and operators create more welcoming third places-places that are not home, not work, but those where we can relax in the company of others. It includes eight case studies by authors from four countries that ground the theories in real-life third places. Its practical design guidelines cover location, accessibility, seating, lighting, sound and more. Written for students, academics and designers, this book discusses the value of coffee shops and cafés and guides readers through the ways to create a place of belonging that brings people together"--
