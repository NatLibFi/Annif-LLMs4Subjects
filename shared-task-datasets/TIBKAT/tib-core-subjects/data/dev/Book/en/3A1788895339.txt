Innovate rail research and education
Energy and emissions saving in urban guided transport systems: effectiveness and assessment of hydrogen-based solutions -- Rail station boarding systems for persons with reduced mobility (PRMs) -- measuring the impacts on the economic growth of various countries using key performance indictors â€“ A quantitative approach including logistics performance, infrastructure, rail network and volume of goods carried -- Safety and delays at level crossings in the united states: addressing the need for multi-objective resource allocation -- Study of sustainable transport enhancements through analysing utilisation levels of rail lines with enhanced passenger and freight services: a case study on a local rail line through simulation modelling and scenarios -- Analysis and Characterization of Noise Generated in Heavy-Haul Railways in Brazil.
This book offers a timely collection of articles on innovative research and developments in the vast field of rail transport, including rail operations, management, economics, vehicles interior design and sustainable infrastructure. It addresses academics and professionals specializing in railway transport analysis, innovation, systems design and new technology. Continuing on the tradition of the previous volumes, the book reports on innovative solutions for energy saving, noise reduction and baggage handling. It elaborates on the implementation of digital technologies and discusses sustainable rail operations along transport corridors. The concept of hyperloop is also discussed as a possible transport mode of the future. All the contributions were selected through an internal competition and a double-blinded peer review process organized by the RailUniNet members .
