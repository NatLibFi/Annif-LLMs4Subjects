The anatomy and evolution of industries : technological change and industrial dynamics
In this challenging book, Orietta Marsili examines the relationship between industrial dynamics and technological change. By combining formal evolutionary modelling with empirical evidence, she illustrates how the characteristics of innovative processes in different technological regimes influence market structure and dynamics. The book is divided into three sections; part one provides the analytical background, part two identifies the characteristics of technological regimes and part three develops a formal evolutionary model which links technological regimes to the dynamics of industrial competition and accounts for empirical regularities identified earlier in the book. Significantly, the author introduces a new taxonomy of technical regimes, which groups sets of production activities together - an important and valuable step away from traditional industrial classifications. The author concludes by stressing the usefulness of industrial regimes, proposing directions for future research and outlining the elements which must be considered if the relationship between industrial dynamics and technological change is to be fully understood. This innovative book will be welcomed by those in the fields of industrial economics, evolutionary economics, the economics of innovation and technological change and public policymakers
