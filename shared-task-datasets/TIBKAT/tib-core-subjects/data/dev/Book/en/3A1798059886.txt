Campus Medius: Digital Mapping in Cultural and Media Studies
Digital cartography offers new opportunities for research in cultural and media studies. Simon Ganahl documents the development of a project from a historical case study to a mapping platform. Based on the question what a media experience is, the concepts of the apparatus (dispositif) and the actor-network are translated into a data model. A time-space of 24 hours in Vienna in May 1933, marked by a so-called »Turks Deliverance Celebration« (Türkenbefreiungsfeier), serves as an empirical laboratory. This Austrofascist rally is mapped from multiple perspectives and weaved into media-historical networks, spanning from the seventeenth century up to the present day.
