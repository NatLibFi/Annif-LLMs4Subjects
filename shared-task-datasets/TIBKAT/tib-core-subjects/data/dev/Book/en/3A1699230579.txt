Pietro Cicognani : architecture and design
"For the past thirty years, Italian-born Pietro Cicognani has been designing highly customized and exquisitely crafted country houses, city apartments, outbuildings, pool houses, and even garden plans for an A-list clientele. In the first monograph on his work, some twenty of his most notable projects are featured, including a reconverted barn complex on Long Island, a sprawling estate in upstate New York, a chic minimalist townhouse in Manhattan, and a romantic seaside house and elaborate garden in the Hamptons. Whether a new construction or a gut renovation, each of his projects is designed in collaboration with the finest artisans and exceptional interior designers. Illustrated with specially commissioned photographs by renowned architecture and interiors photographer Francesco Lagnese, as well site plans and drawings, and featuring a foreword by actress Isabella Rossellini, whose country home he designed, Pietro Cicognani: Architecture and Design is a feast for the eyes and a celebration of unstinting design excellence"--
