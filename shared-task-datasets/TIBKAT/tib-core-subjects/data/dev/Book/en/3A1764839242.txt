The second edition of this well-received textbook is devoted to Combinatorics and Graph Theory, which are cornerstones of Discrete Mathematics. Every section begins with simple model problems. Following their detailed analysis, the reader is led through the derivation of definitions, concepts, and methods for solving typical problems. Theorems then are formulated, proved, and illustrated by more problems of increasing difficulty
