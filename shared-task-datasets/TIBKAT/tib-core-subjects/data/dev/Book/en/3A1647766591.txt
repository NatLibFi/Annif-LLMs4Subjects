Robotic Urology
Robotic surgery is in a phase of worldwide rapid evolution. Data from many centers indicate that urologists are achieving equivalent, or better, operative outcomes using a robotic laparoscopic interface compared with their open results. Patients benefit from quicker convalescence, less pain, and shorter hospital stays. The multi-authored international text covers the robotic operative procedures in urology that are routinely performed today and still in evolution. It focuses on robotic radical prostatectomy and includes robotic procedures for the kidney, adrenal gland, and urinary bladder. The most essential steps are depicted in illustrations. This book should contribute to the support of new robotic teams and continue to popularize robotic urology.
