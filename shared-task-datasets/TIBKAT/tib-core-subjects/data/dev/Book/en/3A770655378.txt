Biomaterials and medical tribology : research and development
This book publishes high quality articles (full research articles, review articles and cases studies) with a special emphasis on research and development in biomaterials and medical tribology and its applications. Within the book, all types of biomaterials are addressed, including metals and alloys, polymers, ceramics or composites and the relationships between biomaterials and medical tribology are discussed. Tribology is a branch of mechanical engineering that deals with the design, friction, wear and lubrication of interacting surfaces in relative motion. By extension it is usual to define medical tribology as the tribological phenomena occurring in the human body. Biomaterials as a term has no set definition, instead there are a varied selection such as 'a synthetic material used to replace part of a living system or to function in intimate contact with living tissue' or a more formal definition by Clemson University Advisory Board of 'biomaterials is a systemically and pharmacologically inert substance designed for implantation within or incorporation with living systems', which will be developed further.--
