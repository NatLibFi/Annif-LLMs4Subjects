Self-healing materials : principles and technology
"The self-healing phenomenon, adapted from living things, was for a long time an exciting topic of discussion on the potential improvements of human-made products, but for quite a while, it became applicable reality useful in many manufactured products. Ironically, the expectations from the healing of commercial products are higher than in the case of living things (for example, skin healing leaves scars that would not be acceptable for self-healed phone, watch, radio receiver, etc.) The most up-to-date information presented in this book gives a full account of means, ways, and practical results to prevent discarding products because they were once damaged."--
