"...a welcome addition to the SystemC literature. Those new to SystemC will find it a very good introduction, and those who have already been exposed to SystemC will find it a useful reference. The style is straightforward and the extensive use of examples gives quick insight into using SystemC in real designs...." (John Sanguinetti, Ph.D., Chief Technical Officer, Forte Design Systems) "...your book helped me bridge the gap in my understanding of the SystemC scheduler and the language features with examples that are easy to follow. The discussion on a TLM approach is also very insightful." (Suhas Pai, QUALCOMM, Inc.) "...well written, and a much-needed overview of SystemC. I like that the book introduces features in context, and with enough code to help the reader understand, but without burying them in code. I found it remarkably easy to read." (Andy Meyer, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.) SystemC provides a robust set of extensions to C++ that enables rapid development of complex hardware/software systems. This book focuses on the practical uses of the language for modeling real systems. The wealth of examples and downloadable code methodically guide the reader through the finer points of the SystemC language. This book will show you: -A step-by-step build-up of syntax, -NEW features of SystemC 2.1, -Code examples for each concept, -Many resource references, -Coding styles and guidelines, -Over 52 downloadable code examples (over 8,000 lines), -Exercises throughout the book, -How SystemC fits into the system design methodology, -Why features are as they are. Well known consultants in the EDA industry, both David Black and Jack Donovan have been involved in the adoption and teaching of new technologies and methodologies for a combined total of 42+ years. Recently, they jointly founded a consultancy, Eklectic Ally, focused on helping companies adopt SystemC methodologies.
