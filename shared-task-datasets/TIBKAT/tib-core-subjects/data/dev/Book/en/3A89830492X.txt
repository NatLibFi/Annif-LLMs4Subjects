Supersymmetric quantum mechanics : an introduction
"The book is an outgrowth of a seminar course taught to physics and mathematics juniors and seniors at Loyola University Chicago. It is written at a level accessible to an undergraduate student (and anyone else) who has studied ordinary differential equations and some matrix algebra, and has had an introduction to the Schr√∂dinger equation (which we review in Chapter 2). Our goal is to provide a single compact source for anyone who wants to understand the essentials of supersymmetric quantum mechanics"--
