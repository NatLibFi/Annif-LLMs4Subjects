Contemporary algorithms for solving problems in economics and other disciplines
"Numerous problems from diverse disciplines can be converted using mathematical modeling to an equation defined on suitable abstract spaces usually involving the n-dimensional Euclidean space or Hilbert space or Banach Space or even more general spaces. The solution of these equations is sought in closed form. But this is possible only in special cases. That is why researchers and practitioners use algorithms which seems to be the only alternative. Due to the explosion of technology, scientific and parallel computing, faster and faster computers become available. This development simply means that new optimized algorithms should be developed to take advantage of these improvements. There is exactly where we come in with our book containing such algorithms with application especially in problems from Economics but also from other areas such as Mathematical: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Scientific, Parallel Computing, and also Engineering. The book can be used by senior undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers and practitioners in the aforementioned area in the class room or as a reference material. Readers should know the fundamentals of numerical functional analysis, economic theory, and Newtonian physics. Some knowledge of computers and contemporary programming shall be very helpful to the readers"--
