Local gradient theory for dielectrics : fundamentals and applications
A review of the gradient and nonlocal theories of electrothermoelastic polarized media -- Thermodynamic foundations of local gradient electrothermomechanics of polarized non-ferromagnetic solids taking the local mass displacement into account -- Generalized local gradient theories of dielectrics -- Near-surface inhomogeneity of electromechanical fields -- stationary harmornic wave processes.
Devoted to the development of a local gradient theory of dielectrics, this book begins with a brief description of the known approaches to the construction of generalized (integral- and gradient-type) continuum theories. It then presents a new continuum-thermodynamic approach for constructing the nonlinear local gradient theory of thermoelastic and non-ferromagnetic polarized media. This approach considers non-diffusive and non-convective mass fluxes associated with changes in material microstructure. Within the linear approximation, the theory has been applied to study the transition modes of the formation of near-surface inhomogeneity of coupled fields in solids, disjoining pressure in thin films, etc. The theory describes a number of observable phenomena that cannot be explained within the classical theory of dielectrics, including the surface, size, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and thermopolarization effects in centrosymmetric crystals; Meadâ€™s anomaly; and high-frequency dispersion of elastic waves.--Back cover
