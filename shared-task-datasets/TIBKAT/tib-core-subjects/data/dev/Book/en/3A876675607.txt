Concurrent and distributed computing in Java
Concurrent and Distributed Computing in Java addresses fundamental concepts in concurrent computing with Java examples. The book consists of two parts. The first part deals with techniques for programming in shared-memory based systems. The book covers concepts in Java such as threads, synchronized methods, waits, and notify to expose students to basic concepts for multi-threaded programming
Concurrent and Distributed Computing in Java addresses fundamental concepts in concurrent computing with Java examples. The book consists of two parts. The first part deals with techniques for programming in shared-memory based systems. The book covers concepts in Java such as threads, synchronized methods, waits, and notify to expose students to basic concepts for multi-threaded programming. It also includes algorithms for mutual exclusion, consensus, atomic objects, and wait-free data structures. The second part of the book deals with programming in a message-passing system. This part covers resource allocation problems, logical clocks, global property detection, leader election, message ordering, agreement algorithms, checkpointing, and message logging. Primarily a textbook for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, this thorough treatment will also be of interest to professional programmers
