Fundamentals of picoscience
"This volume provides the first focused treatment of the materials and methods used at the picoscale, which is the size regime for an individual atom. It addresses the key challenges in developing new instrumentation and techniques to visualize and measure structures at this sub-nanometer level. After introducing single-atom science and the synthesis and analysis of monatomic wires, the book presents picoscale methods ranging from STM to spectroscopic approaches at sub-nanometer spatial and energy resolutions. It also covers novel picoscale structures, molecular dynamics, "atom-by-atom" construction of molecules, biovisualization, and picoscale device applications, including the picomotor and single-photon quantum devices"--
"Nanoscale science has brought many new effects and inventions, and is the basis for a worldwide surge in nanotechnology. Currently there are more than one million scientists involved in projects with nanoscale structures and materials. From the development of new quantum mechanical methods to far-reaching applications in the electronic industry and medical diagnostics, nanoscience has inspired numerous scientists and engineers to new instrumental developments and inventions"--
