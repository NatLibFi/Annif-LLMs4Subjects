Selected works of Murray Rosenblatt
During the second half of the 20th century, Murray Rosenblatt was one of the most celebrated and leading figures in probability and statistics with particular emphasis on time series, Markov processes, and nonparametric function estimation. Among his many contributions, Rosenblatt conducted seminal work on density estimation, central limit theorems under strong mixing, spectral domain methods, long memory processes and Markov processes. The Rosenblatt name has been attached to two notable terms, the Rosenblatt Transformation (based on his 1952 paper) and the Rosenblatt Process a term coined by Murad Taqqu. Throughout his long and continuing career, Rosenblatt has published over 130 papers, and 5 books, many as relevant today as when they first appeared more than 50 years ago. This volume is a celebration of Murray Rosenblatt s stellar research career that spans over six decades, and includes some of his most interesting and influential papers. Several leading experts provide commentary and reflections on various directions of Murray s research portfolio. Murray is an accomplished advisor to over twenty PhD students and is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of California San Diego.
